{"info": "The 5-year project builds on the achievements and lessons learned from the first Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Communicable Diseases Control Project (RCDCP), which played a major role in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) in containing the spread of emerging diseases, improving provincial health systems and communicable disease control (CDC) in vulnerable groups, and strengthening regional cooperation. The project will further enhance regional CDC systems, including improved regional cooperation capacity, expanded surveillance and response systems, and targeted support for the control of dengue and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It will also improve provincial capacity for CDC, including staff training and community-based CDC in border districts. The project will particularly benefit the poor and ethnic groups in border districts, especially women and children.", "bounds": [[100.0970732020001, 13.91545664500012, 107.66436324000011, 22.49604400700011]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[15.75, 106.25], [21.75, 102.33333], [20.16667, 101.5], [20.91667, 101.33333], [17.5, 105.33333], [20.5, 104.0], [14.75, 106.0], [14.66667, 107.0], [15.5, 107.0], [20.5, 100.5], [18.5, 104.33333], [19.41667, 103.5]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "SECOND GMS REGIONAL COMMUNICABLE DISEASES CONTROL", "id": "46004-41507-012-GRNT0232"}
