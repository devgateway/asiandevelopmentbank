{"info": "The project will assist the government's efforts in the rehabilitation of irrigation and road infrastructure damaged by the severe flooding in northern Afghanistan between March and June 2014. It will assist the rehabilitation of selected (i) small-scale irrigation and rural road infrastructure in 15 worst-affected provinces based on the damage and needs assessment (DNA) undertaken by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) and (ii) larger-scale irrigation system infrastructure in three provinces based on the DNA undertaken by the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW). Damage to traditional (smaller scale) irrigation infrastructure is estimated by MRRD at around $19.6 million in 15 provinces, mainly to canals, intakes and other structures, retaining walls and land. In some locations, land protection requires the construction of new retaining walls. Village roads and bridges were also damaged, with estimated repair or reconstruction costs totaling $12.3 million. Village roads were particularly severely affected. Damage to formal (larger-scale) irrigation infrastructure managed by MEW is estimated at $6.3 million. MEW has identified 22 damaged structures on the irrigation systems it manages in Balkh, Jowzjan, and Samangan provinces that need urgent repair. Most of the subprojects comprise repairs to canals, spillways, bank protection, and repair and reconstruction of the Hacha Qala weir servicing extensive irrigation areas in Jowzjan province.", "bounds": [[60.48677779100012, 29.38660532600005, 74.89230676300014, 38.473673402000145]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "NORTHERN FLOOD-DAMAGED INFRASTRUCTURE EMERGENCY REHABILITATION PROJECT", "id": "46004-48326-001-GRNT0411"}
