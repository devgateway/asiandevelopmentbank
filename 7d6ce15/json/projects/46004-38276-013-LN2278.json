The FMRIP will support the Government\u2019s financial sector reform agenda and development of capital markets and other nonbank financial services. The reform agenda is structured around policy outcomes mostly in line with the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) 2004\u20132010. The policy measures include a set of financial sector reforms to promote diversification of financial channels, and enhance transparency and efficiency in intermediation.
