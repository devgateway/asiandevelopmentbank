It forms part of the country s primary east west highway linking the country s capital, Baku, to the Georgian border. Currently, the bridges and local roads are in poor and critical condition, resulting in high transport costs, long delivery times, and road crashes. This constitutes impediments to non-oil sector growth and poverty reduction in Azerbaijan, as well as regional trade development.
