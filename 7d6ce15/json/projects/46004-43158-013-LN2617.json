{"info": "The Project Loan of $50 million, with a guarantee from the Government of India, aims to help Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) in reaching out to the missing middle - i.e. small borrowers or micro-enterprises who have grown too large for traditional microfinance support, but remain unable to access more conventional bank financing. At least 30% of the Project loan will be used by SIDBI for direct financing of deserving micro-enterprises. For its direct lending operations, SIDBI will ensure that atleast 30% of the subborrowers are qualified women MSME entrepreneurs. Upto 70% of the Project Loan will be used by SIDBI for indirect financing of microenterprises through eligible participating financial institutions (PFIs) which could either be scheduled banks, non-bank financial companies, or microfinance institutions. Twelve states (Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal) are eligible to receive direct or indirect assistance through this Loan.", "bounds": [[68.1434025400001, 6.74555084800015, 97.36225305200006, 35.49540557900009]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[24.0, 88.0], [27.25, 80.75], [11.0, 78.0], [26.0, 74.0], [20.5, 84.41667], [19.5, 75.0], [23.5, 78.5], [13.5, 76.0], [25.75, 85.75], [26.0, 93.0], [16.0, 79.0], [23.75, 85.5]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "MICRO,SMALL & MEDIUM ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT", "id": "46004-43158-013-LN2617"}
