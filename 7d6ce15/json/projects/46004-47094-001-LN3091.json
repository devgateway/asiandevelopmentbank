{"info": "The project will (i) increase capacity of the Jamshoro TPS by installing a 600-MW (net) supercritical coal-fired unit, using an 80/20 blend of imported sub-bituminous coal and domestic lignite when available, and provide 5 years of operation and maintenance (O&M) support; (ii) ensure compliance with the national environmental standards (install emission control devices for the existing units and remediating the site); (iii) enhance capacity of GENCO Holding Company Limited (GHCL) and Jamshoro Power Company Limited (JPCL) by providing financial, technical, and operational training; and (iv) introduce education on coal-fired plant operation. The infrastructure will support government\u2019s plan to have an additional 600-MW unit at the same site. The design includes a flue duct interface that will allow adding carbon capture and storage (CCS) when the technology is available.", "bounds": [[60.8443787030001, 23.694525458000058, 77.0489709880002, 37.054483541000096]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[25.43939, 68.29027]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "JAMSHORO POWER GENERATION PROJECT", "id": "46004-47094-001-LN3091"}
