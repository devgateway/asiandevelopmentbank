{"info": "The project will increase access to water supply and sanitation, improving the health and quality of life of the rural population in six selected provinces in the central coastal region of Viet Nam. The project will support the government in implementing its Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2006-2010, including reducing poverty to 10%-11% of households by 2010. In so doing, it will help the government to achieve the Vietnamese Millennium Development Goals. The project will provide piped water and hygienic sanitation to about 350,000 people living in rural areas. The project has a strong poverty focus and its design is based on lessons from previous interventions in the sector. The implementation will follow a community-based approach and will focus on (i) improving hygienic behavior, (ii) strengthening operation and maintenance of the water supply works, and (iii) monitoring and evaluation of the outputs and impacts of rural water supply and sanitation investments.", "bounds": [[102.11865523300011, 8.565578518000152, 109.47242272200018, 23.366275127000122]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[13.99893, 108.80588], [13.93922, 108.81471], [19.25, 104.91667], [20.06667, 105.33333], [17.5, 106.33333], [18.33333, 105.75], [14.16667, 109.0], [15.58333, 107.91667], [19.93354, 105.85251], [19.07732, 105.58751], [18.4584, 105.88789], [18.45555, 105.90788], [17.66337, 106.48868], [15.84999, 107.4869]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "CENTRAL REGION RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR PROJECT", "id": "46004-40364-013-LN2609"}
