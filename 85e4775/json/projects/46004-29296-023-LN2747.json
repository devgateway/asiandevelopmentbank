{"info": "The Project was prepared in 2003. This led to approval of an initial ADB loan of SDR63.042 million in November 2003 with cofinancing from the Agence Fran\u00c2\u00bfaise de D\u00c2\u00bfveloppement (AFD) of \u00c2\u00bf29.6 million.  Project implementation was initially deficient and has also been affected by cost increases caused by high inflation in Viet Nam s economy. This has led to cost overruns and a financing gap of $131.6 million (see Table 1). However, implementation progress improved markedly with the mobilization of project implementation consultants in May 2006 and the transfer of overall project management responsibility to the Hydraulic Project Investment and Construction Management Board No.9 (ICMB9), based in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), in November 2006.", "bounds": [[102.11865523300011, 8.565578518000152, 109.47242272200018, 23.366275127000122]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[11.33333, 106.16667], [10.75, 106.75], [15.64692, 107.98919], [10.7, 106.16667], [10.82327, 106.62978], [11.1, 106.96667], [11.4, 106.71667], [11.33333, 106.0], [11.08333, 106.36667], [11.58333, 106.0], [11.0, 106.5], [10.86667, 106.41667], [11.16667, 106.66667], [11.33333, 106.5], [11.75, 106.91667], [11.26461, 106.76582]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "PHUOC HOA WATER RESOURCES PROJECT - SUPPLEMENTARY", "id": "46004-29296-023-LN2747"}
