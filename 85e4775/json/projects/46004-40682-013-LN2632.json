{"info": "The project will improve the performance of the biogas subsector through the demonstration of an integrated renewable biomass energy system in the poor rural areas of Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangxi, and Shandong provinces, where the densities of livestock are almost triple the national average and the pollution problems from livestock farms and agro-enterprises are severe. There are 66 national poverty counties and 131 provincial poverty counties in the four participating provinces, with a poor population of about 9 million. About 43% of the project s subprojects are located in these poor counties. \nThe project consists of four components: (i) sustainable development and demonstration of commercial practices of medium- and large-scale biogas plants (MLBGPs), (ii) effective utilization of biogas sludge in eco-farming, (iii) capacity development for improved sector performance, and (iv) project implementation support. \nThe project will assist about 118 medium-sized and large livestock farms and agro-enterprises in constructing biogas plants, and introduce a new technical specification to the plant design. The new specification involves the installation of high-temperature flares in the MLBGPs to minimize the methane gas emissions during maintenance and emergency this has been a common standard in developed countries but not yet in the PRC. The project will also demonstrate business models of centralized biogas plant systems to improve their cost-effectiveness, and technical and environmental performances; and assist 25 subprojects to overcome barriers to connect to local power grids to maximize the benefits of biogas power generation. The project will also support subprojects in manufacturing of bio-fertilizers from the biogas sludge and in eco-farming to achieve the government s goal of  circular economy,  which is to reuse and recycle organic waste in rural areas, and improve livelihoods in the project area. \n\nCapacity development activities will be carried out to (i) strengthen technical service systems and human resources for biogas plant design, operation, and maintenance in the participating provinces; (ii) demonstrate best design and operational practices of MLBGPs; and (iii) develop a performance monitoring system to improve the subsector performance. The project will also support the MLBGPs in connecting and selling electricity to the local power grids. The revenue of the power sale will help improve the financial viability of the MLBGPs.\n\nThe project will provide consulting services to assist in the review of subproject preparation and implementation to ensure timely and effective project implementation.", "bounds": [[73.6022563070002, 15.775376695000048, 134.7725793870002, 53.56944447900004]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[36.0, 119.0], [28.0, 116.0], [34.0, 114.0], [48.0, 128.0]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "INTEGRATED RENEWABLE BIOMASS ENERGY DEVELOPMENT SECTOR PROJECT", "id": "46004-40682-013-LN2632"}
