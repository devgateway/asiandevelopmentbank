{"info": "The components proposed for financing under the requested PFR include Road Connectivity and Capacity Building. \n\nA. Road Connectivity component\n \nThis comprises construction of rural roads that are part of the PMGSY to provide connectivity to all habitations of population of 500 persons (250 or more in hilly or desert areas, or scheduled tribe areas) or more with all weather roads. Subprojects covering about 3,461 km in total (342 km in Assam, 1,008 km in Chhattisgarh, 1,187 km in Madhya Pradesh, 757 km in Odisha, and 167 km in West Bengal) are proposed to be taken up in the 1st PFR. \n\nB. Capacity Building component\n\nThis component will include (i) support to the establishment of Rural Connectivity Training and Research Centers (RCTRCs); (ii) support to the establishing of Rural Road Network Management Units (RRNMUs) in each participating state; (iii) assistance to the MORD/NRRDA and state governments in implementation of the additional policy, and administrative requirements inherent to ADB-assisted projects; and (iv) additional support in operation, monitoring, evaluation and risk management. \n\nOne RCTRC and one pilot RRNMU will be established in each state under PFR 1. The support will include construction of modern field offices, including laboratories and providing all necessary state-of-the art equipment, system and tools. Support to RCTRCs will also include consulting services to assist staff in rolling out systematic and large scale training in participating states and support RCTRCs in research and compiling best practices and experiences in rural roads. \n\nAssistance to the MORD/NRRDA and state governments to comply with administrative requirements inherent to ADB-assisted projects, and additional support in operation, monitoring, evaluation and risk management will be provided through the engagement of a Project Implementation Consultant (PIC) engaged and financed by the Government of India, and Technical Support Consultant (TSC) engaged by NRRDA and financed by ADB.", "bounds": [[68.1434025400001, 6.74555084800015, 97.36225305200006, 35.49540557900009]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[20.75, 85.5], [19.96378, 82.71043], [22.51046, 83.97707], [23.25, 88.5], [21.5, 82.0], [22.02434, 82.23168], [21.87212, 82.45306], [22.50449, 83.95004], [21.95799, 80.8786], [22.8436, 82.19919], [23.48326, 82.15037], [21.31506, 83.00548], [21.55, 81.78333], [23.16, 79.95], [20.27241, 85.83385], [22.71, 88.7108], [22.09006, 83.44088], [20.55686, 86.19194], [20.93385, 85.5449], [19.69386, 84.81401], [21.18972, 86.33134], [20.05756, 86.00436], [21.22564, 83.91354], [20.81516, 84.63259], [21.5, 86.75], [21.65, 83.6], [21.059, 86.61398], [20.833, 84.333], [20.21322, 86.16373], [20.68208, 86.31993], [21.85, 84.0], [20.52034, 86.26918], [20.21456, 85.71429], [20.13706, 85.15375], [21.07226, 83.61622], [21.6182, 83.46169], [26.91585, 88.64714], [22.79866, 86.95145], [24.58, 77.73], [23.83556, 80.39417], [24.47, 74.87], [26.47104, 91.0308], [25.01058, 92.42705], [26.75, 92.13135], [26.1509, 90.0344], [27.6, 95.6], [27.5, 95.0], [26.1126, 90.79179], [26.63333, 93.83333], [26.22322, 91.65344], [26.0, 93.5], [24.6, 92.4], [26.35037, 92.69225], [26.5, 91.4], [25.5, 93.0], [27.08992, 95.02345], [26.76748, 92.96425], [26.4603, 90.6464], [27.50491, 94.4358], [26.8, 94.26], [26.43333, 90.36667], [27.35, 94.25], [26.25213, 92.34238], [22.4424, 88.5162], [26.83644, 88.62943], [23.05223, 87.44346], [26.51974, 88.7146], [26.86463, 88.74526], [24.34495, 88.32356], [23.25, 87.25], [23.04552, 88.83084], [22.74431, 88.78655], [26.4835, 89.52286], [22.75833, 88.80278], [24.1, 88.25], [21.8457, 88.375], [22.71, 88.7108], [26.55611, 88.50861], [22.80001, 86.94999], [23.88847, 87.98843], [23.9072, 87.99653], [23.0506, 87.51215], [22.78376, 88.80589], [26.5888, 89.30846], [24.42707, 88.16573], [23.05432, 87.52449], [24.46669, 88.06167], [24.25, 82.0], [26.5, 78.75], [23.25, 77.25], [24.75, 79.75], [21.71122, 79.09887], [23.55802, 79.67776], [22.49646, 76.98182], [22.5, 75.25], [24.5, 77.5], [22.66667, 75.75], [23.16, 79.95], [24.33333, 75.25], [23.99552, 77.13953], [23.58333, 75.16667], [23.75, 78.75], [24.5, 81.0], [22.94591, 77.03486], [23.59403, 75.94402], [24.75, 79.0], [23.41667, 75.5], [24.14859, 74.90517], [23.82912, 75.55753], [26.75, 92.13135], [26.22322, 91.65344], [23.5, 77.41667], [21.86667, 81.85], [23.96603, 81.51465]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "RURAL CONNECTIVITY INVESTMENT PROGRAM-TRANCHE 1", "id": "46004-40423-023-LN2881"}
