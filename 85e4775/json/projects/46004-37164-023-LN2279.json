{"info": "The FSDP aims to address the main constraints in the financial system that impede financial sector development and efficient financial intermediation. The main constraints include (i) a weak legal, regulatory, and supervisory regime; (ii) poor governance structures and inefficient operations of financial institutions; (iii) vulnerability to malpractice for lack of effective anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) regimes; (iv) the absence of national accounting and auditing standards; and (v) an inadequate system of financial information disclosure. Consequently, FSDP aims, through improved governance, specifically to enhance the investment environment, improve access to finance, and promote market-based incentives for providing diversified financial services aimed at encouraging private sector activity and promoting economic growth.\n\nThe purpose of the project loan is to facilitate the implementation of the FSDP and ensure the smooth implementation and sustainability of its policy reforms. The project loan will provide (i) urgently needed training of the regulator and key institutions in the areas covered under the FSDP, (ii) the development of adequate AML/CFT regulation and infrastructure, (iii) improved accounting and auditing practices, (iv) technical support to create a CIB, and (v) improved securities information disclosure.", "bounds": [[88.73006677200013, 26.69614939400016, 92.08877648900014, 28.358398930786294]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM", "id": "46004-37164-023-LN2279"}
