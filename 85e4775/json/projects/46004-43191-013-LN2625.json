{"info": "The Economic Recovery Support Program (ERSP) provides for elevated government capital expenditure to undertake post-tsunami reconstruction and provide a short-term boost to economic activity (output 1). Complementary policy actions will safeguard the overall fiscal position and enhance the quality of government expenditure (output 2). Structural and governance improvements will support medium-term prospects for economic growth by enhancing the economy's productivity (output 3). Policy actions will also provide opportunities for the vulnerable to make economic growth more inclusive (output 4). Engaging private sector and civil society stakeholders in public policy will be enhanced to deepen local awareness, understanding, and ownership of the ERSP (output 5). The five outputs will progress concurrently under the two subprograms of the ERSP. The ERSP targets economic growth led by the private sector. At the macro level, the ERSP will assist the private sector by supporting aggregate demand and lessening the risk that fiscal stress will bring macroeconomic instability. At the micro level, the ERSP will emphasize ensuring sound public investment, continuing to rationalize state-owned enterprises, improving the performance of those that remain under government ownership, ensuring effective competition in the economy and thorough efforts to modernize the legal framework affecting business.", "bounds": [[187.21741783900012, -14.05282968499999, 188.56230716200008, -13.46282317499994]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "ECONOMIC RECOVERY SUPPORT PROGRAM - SUBPROGRAM 1 (SF)", "id": "46004-43191-013-LN2625"}
