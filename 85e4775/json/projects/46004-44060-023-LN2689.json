{"info": "This is a multitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund (Damu), guaranteed by the Republic of Kazakhstan, for the Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Program. The MFF is proposed to help Damu--through participating financial institutions (PFIs)--address the unmet demand for longer-term, fixed-rate, local currency denominated credit by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),  and thereby address a key constraint to the development of SMEs. \n\nDamu has requested an MFF of the local currency equivalent of $500 million to help finance part of the investment program. The MFF will be structured into three or four tranches, all of which will be sovereign guaranteed. The first tranche amounts to the local currency equivalent of $150 million. Tranche 2 is estimated at $150 million, local currency equivalent. Tranches 3 and 4 are estimated at $100 million, local currency equivalent. Financing under tranches 2, 3, and 4 may vary depending on the demand for market-based credit by viable SMEs as market conditions improve; the availability of external credit for Kazakh financial institutions; and the interest of such institutions in participating in the facility. Financing will also depend on the availability of ADB resources and will be subject to Damu's submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related loan agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement.", "bounds": [[46.47827884900002, 40.58465566000008, 87.3237960210001, 55.434550273000085]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[48.0, 68.0]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "MFF-SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE INVESTMENT PROGRAM -TRANCHE 1", "id": "46004-44060-023-LN2689"}
