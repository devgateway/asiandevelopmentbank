{"info": "The main objective is to help fulfill local demand, as Himachal Pradesh experiences energy shortages, especially in the winter months of December to February when river flows are at their lowest, with some peak shortages experienced throughout the year. Surplus power, particularly due to strong river flows from the spring snow melt, will be exported to the northern grid, thus serving as an important source of revenue for the state. However, the program will benefit all Northern Grid-connected electricity consumers via the export of excess power and by eliminating the need to import power from the Northern Grid, thus assisting  the Government in its efforts to increase its overall generating capacity and  achieve universal electrification under the 11th Five Year Plan. The second main objective is to provide capacity development assistance in order to develop the state hydropower generating company, Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd., into an efficient, corporatized generation company.\n\nThe scope of this tranche includes construction of the Sawra Kuddu (111 MW) hydroelectric project and the civil works for the Kashang Hydroelectric project.", "bounds": [[68.1434025400001, 6.74555084800015, 97.36225305200006, 35.49540557900009]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[31.16667, 77.58333], [31.58333, 78.41667]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "MFF-HIMACHAL PRADESH CLEAN ENERGY DEV'T INVESTMENT PROGRAM-TR1", "id": "46004-41627-023-LN2461"}
