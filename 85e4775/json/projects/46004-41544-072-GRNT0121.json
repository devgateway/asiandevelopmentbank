{"info": "The Project aims to reduce the cost of doing business by streamlining business registration process and export and import clearance procedures. Specifically, the Project will support the establishment of a one-stop shop for business registration and a pre-customs single window for export and import clearance. The Project will have the following main components.\n\n1. One-Stop Shop Business Registration. The Project will support the implementation of an automated one-stop shop that will allow all registration formalities to be completed in MOJ.  This will significantly reduce the time taken to register a business (from 21 days to 3 days), and will reduce the uncertainty associated with the approval process. A summary of the one-stop shop blueprint is in Supplementary Appendix A.\n\n2. Pre-Customs Single Window. The Project will support the implementation of a pre-customs single window to enable businesses to submit applications and receive permits and certifications for exports and imports through a single channel. Currently, pre-customs clearance requires at least 12 separate approvals and about 25 days clearance time.  By streamlining and harmonizing regulations and automatic processes, the pre-customs single window will enable businesses to obtain clearances within 5 days and through a single administrative document", "bounds": [[69.22629602000012, 39.189236959000084, 80.2575606690001, 43.261701558000084]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "INVESTMENT CLIMATE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM SYSTEM SUPP", "id": "46004-41544-072-GRNT0121"}
