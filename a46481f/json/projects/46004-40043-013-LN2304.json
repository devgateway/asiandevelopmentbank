This line will be ultimately linked to Afghanistan s major electricity demand centre, Kabul, through the Afghan 220 kV corridor currently under construction, linking Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul.\n\nThe Project will also include upgrading and new investments in Tajikistan that will help reduce the winter power deficit by (i) increasing the available level of generation, and (ii) decreasing the level of technical losses in south Tajikistan. Both measures will aim to export 300 megawatt (MW) to Afghanistan and generate additional 320 gigawatt-hour (GWh) annually in Tajikistan. \n\nThe Project is in line with the governments' strategies and policies. In Afghanistan, the policy is to provide reliable power supply to all Afghans. In Tajikistan, the policy is to maximize the use of its hydropower assets. \n\nThe project scope has been coordinated with other external funding agencies.", "bounds": [[60.48677779100012, 29.38660532600005, 74.89230676300014, 38.473673402000145]], "name": "REGIONAL POWER TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION PROJ-AFHAN COMPONENT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[37.19041, 68.61126], [36.72896, 68.857], [36.00118, 68.64001]]}}}
