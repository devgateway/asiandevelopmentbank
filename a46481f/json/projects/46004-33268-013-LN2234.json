Activities include establishing sustainable productive technologies with arrested environmental and resource degradation through integrated resource management, including agriculture and livestock production, and farm and community forestry. New construction and upgrading of existing infrastructure for production, water consumption, and transportation represent significant aspects of the Project. Project management will operate closely with government line departments and the Project will be implemented through community participation to improve community involvement in designing and implementing project interventions. Capacity-building initiatives, as well as training in community organization, \nstrengthened project management skills, and improved institutional capabilities for line departments to better address the needs of the poorer segments of the society are important project activities. \n\nThe key development objective of the Project is to improve the productive potential of selected watersheds and their associated natural resource base. An associated objective is to strengthen the capacity of the communities in the Project area for participatory involvement in planning, implementation, social and environmental management, maintenance of assets emanating from local development programs, and to have the implementating departments in the Project area operate in a more socially inclusive manner within the framework of a convergent watershed development planning process.", "bounds": [[60.8443787030001, 23.694525458000058, 77.0489709880002, 37.054483541000096]], "name": "FEDERALLY ADMINISTERED TRIBAL AREAS RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[34.46386, 71.35116], [33.96113, 71.0577], [34.75732, 71.49067]]}}}
