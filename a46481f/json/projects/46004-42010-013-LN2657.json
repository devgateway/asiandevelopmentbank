{"id": "46004-42010-013-LN2657", "info": "The project  will support the urban development of three medium-sized cities in the southwestern part of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) Fangchenggang City, Chongzuo City, and Baise City. All the project cities are surrounded by counties with widespread poverty. The project will have six investment components in the project cities and one capacity development component. The investment components in each project city will be part of an overall city development program guided by a well-prepared city development master plan. The capacity development component is designed to complement the infrastructure development to be funded under the project. \n\nThe project has a number of special features. It is part of the national poverty reduction strategy to promote inclusive growth in the less-developed western PRC. All the project cities are at strategic positions of the regional transport corridors under the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) economic cooperation framework. Development of the urban economy in these cities is the driving force in converting these transport corridors into economic corridors for GMS economic cooperation, which the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting. The project has adopted a holistic approach to building urban roads and underground municipal infrastructure in a coherent and integrated manner. Construction of urban infrastructure is supported with capacity development and environmental improvement components, including activities to strengthen climate change resilience of coastal and inland urban areas.\n", "bounds": [[73.6022563070002, 15.775376695000048, 134.7725793870002, 53.56944447900004]], "name": "GUANGXI SOUTHWESTERN CITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[23.9, 106.61667], [23.89972, 106.61333], [22.46541, 107.39622], [21.9358, 107.95932], [21.68686, 108.35385]]}}}
