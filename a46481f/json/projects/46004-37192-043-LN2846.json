The investments will enhance the efficiency of the overall power transmission system and provide an adequate and reliable power supply to a greater number of industrial, commercial and residential consumers. \n\nThe Tranche 3 subprojects will improve power transmission infrastructure through development of additional 500 kV transmission lines and grid substations facilities, and relieve the power system bottlenecks. Tranche 3 will specifically (i) increase interregional transmission capacity and (ii) evacuate power from new power stations to the load centers. \n\nThe outputs of the subprojects in Tranche 3 include (i) addition of approximately 600 km 500 kV transmission lines, (ii) commission of one new 500 kV grid station and expansion of four existing 500 kV grid substations, (iii) improved security of supply to customers by moving towards compliance with regulatory security standards governing planning and operation, and (iv) improved reliability of the primary transmission system. \n", "bounds": [[60.8443787030001, 23.694525458000058, 77.0489709880002, 37.054483541000096]], "name": "POWER TRANSMISSION ENHANCEMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM-TRANCHE 3", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[29.84064, 68.01552], [29.5448, 67.8764], [28.41986, 70.30345], [26.66459, 68.00156], [34.33333, 73.2], [26.83477, 69.06444], [25.43939, 68.29027], [26.73286, 67.77631], [29.21145, 67.73273], [27.81569, 69.65807]]}}}
