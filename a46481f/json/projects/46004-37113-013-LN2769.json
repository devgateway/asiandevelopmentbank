{"id": "46004-37113-013-LN2769", "info": "The project will address two key areas in the electricity supply industry in Bangladesh which suffers from acute power shortages: (i) replacing energy-inefficient thermal power plants; and (ii) expanding renewable energy. The project includes (i) replacing five aging generating units with a combined capacity of 274 megawatts (MW) at Ashuganj power station with an efficient combined cycle power plant (CCPP) of 450 MW using natural gas as the fuel source; (ii) installing a 5 MW solar photovoltaic system connected to the national grid at Kaptai; (iii) installing a hybrid wind (1 MW)\u2013solar photovoltaic (1 MW)\u2013diesel (5.5 MW) generating system in Hatiya; and (iv) installing or retrofitting streetlights that use photovoltaic and light-emitting diode (LED) technology in the cities of Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet. These subprojects will help Bangladesh to embark on a program of energy efficiency, source diversification, and reduced dependence on imported fuels.", "bounds": [[88.02178959200009, 20.73871491100003, 92.64285119700017, 26.623544007000064]], "name": "POWER SYSTEM EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[24.89904, 91.87198], [24.374, 88.60114], [23.7104, 90.40744], [22.3384, 91.83168], [24.04016, 91.0117], [22.80978, 89.56439], [22.70497, 90.37013], [22.49419, 92.22089], [22.34, 91.09]]}}}
