The Project will support water quality improvement in several canal and river systems in the project cities through physical investment and improved water management. In addition, the Project will help strengthen water resource protection in the HRB through improved and integrated planning, water quality monitoring, and environmental management. \n\nThe Project has identified 19 physical investment subprojects (8 representative and 11 candidate subprojects) to provide improved wastewater collection and treatment, and water supplies in the 15 project cities. The Project also identified the need for capacity building and training for the project institutions, including county water utility companies. The Project adopts a sector loan approach and will support an area and time slice of the Government?s Henan Hai River Basin Plan, which serves as a sector development plan for the HRB.\n\n", "bounds": [[73.6022563070002, 15.775376695000048, 134.7725793870002, 53.56944447900004]], "name": "HENAN WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT AND WATER SUPPLY SECTOR PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}}}
