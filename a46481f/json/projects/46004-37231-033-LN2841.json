It will replace a 120 years old existing structure. Its main components are (i) main weir and undersluices, (ii) gates and hoisting arrangement, (iii) operating deck and access road, and (iv) canal head regulator and lead channel. The NKB will diver 330 m3sec-1 (11,653 ft3 sec-1) irrigation supplies to the Lower Chenab Canal (LCC) serving about 1.2 million ha agricultural land. The construction of NKB at the upstream end will ensure sustained irrigation delivery to the LCC comman area and will contribute to the outcome of the MFF. The NKB at the upstream end will ensure sustained irrigation delivery to the LCC command are and will contribute to the outcome of the MFF. The NKB will also increase the safe flood discharge capacity from the present 22,654 m3sec-1 (800,000 ft3sec-1) which is less than a one fifty years flood event to 31,149 m3sec-1 (1,100,000 ft3sec-1) equivalent to one in 100 years flood event. Overall 568,000 farming families (310,000 less than 2 ha and 190,000 between 2 to 6 ha) will be benefitted through reliable irrigation supplies.\n\n", "bounds": [[60.8443787030001, 23.694525458000058, 77.0489709880002, 37.054483541000096]], "name": "PUNJAB IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE INVESTMENT PROGRAM (TRANCHE 2)", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[29.34806, 71.02032], [31.70969, 74.1382], [31.32804, 72.35501], [32.1885, 74.05362], [31.23089, 73.19753], [30.92858, 72.53692], [32.02191, 73.51315], [31.48198, 73.69882]]}}}
