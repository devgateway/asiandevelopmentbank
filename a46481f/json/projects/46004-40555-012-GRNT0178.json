These include (i) promotion of vocational and skills training to ensure continuing improvement in national productivity; (ii) creation of jobs in the formal and nonformal sectors; (iii) an increase in agricultural productivity to create jobs in rural areas; and (iv) the establishment of technical vocational education and training (TVET) networks to assist both men and women, especially the poor, disabled and vulnerable, to respond to labor market needs. \n\nThe Project will help ensure an expanded public TVET system that is endorsed by industry and is better aligned with the skills requirements of the formal and informal economies. The project will develop replicable models for transforming the system so it is more relevant to industry, focusing initially on three industry sectors: mechanics, construction, and business services and information and communication technologies (ICT). These models can be used as the basis for continued reform in other industry sectors.", "bounds": [[102.31342370600012, 10.415773620000081, 107.61051639900009, 14.704581605000087]], "name": "STRENGTHENING TECHNICAL & VOCATIONAL EDUCATION & T", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[12.91667, 103.08333], [10.91667, 104.83333], [11.16667, 105.83333], [13.5, 104.0], [13.75, 105.0], [12.75, 107.0], [10.83333, 104.33333], [13.0, 105.0]]}}}
