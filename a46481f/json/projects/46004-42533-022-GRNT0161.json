{"id": "46004-42533-022-GRNT0161", "info": "The Project involves the construction of a new 75 kilometers (km) railway line between Hairatan at the border with Uzbekistan and Mazar-e-Sharif in Afghanistan. The Project represents a first phase of a larger rail network planned across the north and other parts of the country, including links to Herat, Tajikistan, and Pakistan. It will expand the existing transport network in Afghanistan and improve substantially internal and international connectivity. The Project is part of the Transport Strategy and Action Plan agreed under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program. It will add capacity to two transport corridors under CAREC and open up alternative routes of supply for national and international trade, as well as for humanitarian relief to Afghanistan.\n\nThe Project has two components: (i) design and construction of 75 km single-line railway and associated infrastructure; and (ii) project management, independent supervision, and institutional support. The Project will be executed through a fixed price and fixed time delivery engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) turnkey contract. Once constructed, tested, and commissioned, the rail service will be managed by an operator under an operation and maintenance contract.\n", "bounds": [[60.48677779100012, 29.38660532600005, 74.89230676300014, 38.473673402000145]], "name": "HAIRATAN TO MAZAR-E-SHARIF RAILWAY PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[37.2214, 67.4241], [37.12746, 67.54203], [36.70993, 67.1157], [36.70904, 67.11087], [36.84655, 67.21497]]}}}
