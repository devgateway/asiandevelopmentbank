{"id": "46004-44142-013-LN2688", "info": "The proposed technical assistance loan will provide the facility to prepare a series of regional cooperation and integration (RCI) transport projects in roads and railways. The loan will ensure the projects are ready for implementation by providing funding for feasibility studies, detailed design preparation, procurement assistance, and safeguard implementation. The focus will be on priority transport corridors identified in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Regional Multimodal Transport Study.  Transport corridors linking with the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) countries--such as the Asian Highway Network and the Trans-Asia Rail Network--will also be targeted. While the facility will cover 8% of Bangladesh's major roads and 12% of its railways, development of these corridors would complete the subregional land transport network, which will stimulate both subregional trade and the Bangladesh economy.", "bounds": [[88.02178959200009, 20.73871491100003, 92.64285119700017, 26.623544007000064]], "name": "SUBREGIONAL TRANSPORT PROJECT PREPARATORY FACILITY", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[24.0, 90.0]]}}}
