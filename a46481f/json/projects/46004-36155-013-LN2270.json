The outcome will be enhanced private sector participation in infrastructure investment and maintenance to reduce the Government's fiscal burden and provide better infrastructure services to the population and enterprises.  To achieve these objectives, Subprogram ! will (i) strengthen the enabling environment for PPI by addressing remaining policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional constraints to PPI and (ii) provide technical and financial support for PPI projects.\n\nThe PPIP is a cluster program that will consist of Subprogram 1 and Subprogram 2 (the design of which will depend on the outcome of Subprogram 1 and the Government s emerging priorities).  A TA grant will support implementation of Subprogram 1 and capacity building initiatives required to support the Government's PPI initiatives over the medium-and long-term.\n\nBy promoting PPI, the operation will help the Government to leverage more financial resources into infrastructure by using the private sector as an intermediary. This will help to fill the gap between (i) the infrastructure the Government can afford and (ii) the infrastructure needed for economic development and poverty reduction, as articulated under the Government's Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF).
