It is also expected to help SASEC countries improve their productivity and efficiency and participate more fully in the global information economy. To this end, the Project will establish (i) a SASEC regional network with fiber-optic and data interchange capacity, directly connecting the four SASEC countries; (ii) a SASEC village network expanding broadband ICT access to 110 rural communities in the SASEC countries and providing direct connections among the communities for local networking and local information sourcing; and (iii) a SASEC research and training network to build technical and business skills in developing local ICT content and e-applications (e-government, e-learning, tele-medicine, e-remittance, e-commerce, etc.) that serve the needs of the poor in particular.", "bounds": [[88.73006677200013, 26.69614939400016, 92.08877648900014, 28.358398930786294]], "name": "SASEC INFORMATION HIGHWAY PROJECT (BHUTAN)", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[27.46609, 89.64191], [27.5, 90.5], [27.6, 89.58333], [26.91389, 89.42317], [26.85892, 89.39048]]}}}
