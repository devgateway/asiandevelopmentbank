The objective is to improve the socioeconomic conditions of poor rural women through a process of economic, social, legal, and political empowerment by (i) strengthening their individual capabilities to improve their access to and control over assets; (ii) building group support for individual and collective action to influence and hold institutions accountable; and (iii) reforming Government institutions and processes to become gender-responsive and include previously marginalized women into development opportunities. The project components comprise (i) economic empowerment, (ii) legal empowerment, (iii) social empowerment, and (iv) institutional strengthening and project management. The components are mutually supporting to promote a virtuous circle of socioeconomic improvement among poor rural women.", "bounds": [[80.03028772000005, 26.343767802000087, 88.1690674240001, 30.416904195000086]], "name": "GENDER EQUALITY AND EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[26.75, 86.33333], [27.25, 86.0], [27.0, 85.58333], [26.58333, 86.75], [28.41667, 82.25], [27.0, 85.33333], [27.41667, 86.08333], [28.08333, 82.83333], [28.41667, 83.66667], [28.0, 84.0], [29.58333, 82.41667], [26.91667, 85.83333], [27.58333, 85.33333], [27.70169, 85.3206], [28.33333, 84.0], [29.25, 81.83333], [29.27528, 82.18333], [29.25, 80.91667], [27.0, 87.33333], [28.11681, 82.31712], [27.58333, 84.5], [27.66734, 85.41673], [27.08333, 85.08333], [28.16667, 81.83333], [29.5, 81.5], [29.66667, 81.25], [29.5, 80.58333], [28.41667, 83.16667], [29.08333, 81.33333], [26.83, 86.01]]}}}
