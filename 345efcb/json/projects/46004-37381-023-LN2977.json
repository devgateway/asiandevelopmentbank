The Project will supplement funding of the original project  to meet cost overruns to ensure that safe drinking water and sanitation services are provided to the four urban areas of Chilaw, Mannar, Puttalam, and Vavuniya and to achieve the full impact envisaged under the original project. The reasons for the cost overruns are (i) original estimates were based on feasibility studies in 2007 and not on detailed designs, (ii) increase in cost 2008 estimates caused by price escalations between 2009 and 2011 , (iii) increase in distribution pipe diameters to cater for future population growth, and (iv) enhanced water treatment improvements for rehabilitation works at the Chilaw and Puttalam water treatment plants. There will be no changes to the sanitation infrastructure and existing arrangements under the original loan will be followed. The closing date of the Project is December 2016, which will be synchronized with the original project after extension of closing date of the original loan .", "bounds": [[79.65577233200005, 5.92373281500015, 81.89031009200008, 9.829575914000145]], "name": "DRY ZONE URBAN WATER AND SANITATION PROJECT-ADDL FINANCING(SF)", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[8.7514, 80.4971], [8.0362, 79.8283], [8.98333, 79.9], [7.57583, 79.79528]]}}}
