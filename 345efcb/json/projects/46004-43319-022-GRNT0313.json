It is also in line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy 2012 2016 for the Lao PDR and supports ADB s urban operational plan (2012 2020) and water operational plan (2011 2020).\n\nThe project will enhance the competitiveness of towns along the East West Economic Corridor (EWEC), and will complement years of work on trade facilitation and cross-border trade agreements. The project will transform the corridor towns of Kaysone Phomvihane, Phine, and Dansavanh into economic hubs by improving urban environmental infrastructure and strengthening the institutional capacity of provincial and local authorities. The productivity and sustainability of economic enterprises in these towns will be significantly improved, as the flood control measures will increase climate resilience. The environment will be improved through clean wastewater, disposal of solid waste, and enhanced mobility on improved urban roads. The project will provide environmental infrastructure that will, among others, help reduce the carbon footprint of the towns, making them cleaner and greener, and thus more livable. The project will finance seven subprojects in the three towns.", "bounds": [[100.0970732020001, 13.91545664500012, 107.66436324000011, 22.49604400700011]], "name": "GMS EAST-WEST ECONOMIC CORRIDOR TOWNS DEVELOPMENT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[16.5, 105.75], [16.56504, 104.75273], [16.53296, 106.02338]]}}}
