The Project will help the Government to promote its ongoing reform initiative for upper secondary education (USE) through upgrading of teaching and learning to international standards, improve student access and retention, especially in disadvantaged regions and strengthen school management to achieve the planned objectives for USE. Project activities include construction of education facilities for USSs, provision of simulation classrooms for selected teacher training universities (TTUs) to provide practical teaching experiences, improved instructional materials and equipment for disadvantaged schools and planned model schools, oral English materials to improve foreign language learning, pilot support for disabled students at USE level, provincial block grants to local education authorities, pilot teacher training programs through public-private partnership (PPP), support to the National Institute of Education Management (NIEM), and conduct a number of research studies to examine ways to improve USE planning and management. The Project will principally be national in scope, with access-related project investments targeted to selected disadvantaged areas.", "bounds": [[102.11865523300011, 8.565578518000152, 109.47242272200018, 23.366275127000122]], "name": "SECOND UPPER SECONDARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[16.16667, 107.83333]]}}}
