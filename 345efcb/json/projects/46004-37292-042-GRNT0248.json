A demand-driven approach will be used to (i) mobilize interested producer groups; (ii) provide support for quality improvement, value adding, and product aggregation into  quantities of scale sufficient to attract demand-side business; (iii) stimulate private sector agribusiness development; and (iv) reduce risk exposure to businesses investing in the high mountain districts. Project grants will be provided to eligible entities for implementing viable agribusiness plans that demonstrate income and employment benefits in the project districts. The private sector has expressed interest in a range of suitable business development, including (i) organized production of high-value products through contract or supply agreements; (ii) established collection, post-harvest quality grading, and storage facilities; (iii) processing and value adding; and (iv) quality certification to access high-value markets.", "bounds": [[80.03028772000005, 26.343767802000087, 88.1690674240001, 30.416904195000086]], "name": "HIGH MOUNTAIN AGRIBUSINESS AND LIVELIHOOD IMPROVEM", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[27.75, 86.75], [27.58333, 87.33333], [28.16667, 85.33333], [28.91667, 83.91667], [29.58333, 82.41667], [28.66667, 84.25], [29.27528, 82.18333], [29.91667, 81.91667], [29.16667, 83.08333], [27.83333, 86.25]]}}}
