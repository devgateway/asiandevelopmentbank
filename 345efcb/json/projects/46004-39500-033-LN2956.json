This is especially the case in large cities, most notably Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), which are the primary centers of economic growth and will remain so for the foreseeable future. The large cities have grown rapidly over the last 15 years and are expected to continue to grow relative to the rest of the country, both in terms of population and economy. HCMC is the largest city in Viet Nam with an area of about 2,100 sq. km. and a population that has grown at an average of 2.4% over the last 15 years, to about 5.5 million in 2003, or approximately 6% of Viet Nam's total population. On current trends, the city's population is forecast to reach 7.2 million by 2020.", "bounds": [[102.11865523300011, 8.565578518000152, 109.47242272200018, 23.366275127000122]], "name": "MFF:HCM CITY URBAN MASS RAPID TRANSIT LINE 2 INV PROG-T2", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[10.82302, 106.62965], [10.77371, 106.69799], [10.78345, 106.69133], [10.7722, 106.66679], [10.8767, 106.658], [10.80859, 106.65272], [10.79883, 106.62324]]}}}
