The Project will complement and expand Education Sector Project II 2006-2012 (ESP II) activities to include ICT competencies and best practices for developing and using e-learning resources in classroom teaching and learning processes. This will enhance the quality of education and cost-effectively improve student learning outcomes in six academic subjects aligned to the ESP II priorities of mathematics and science. It will also support the Government's efforts to improve the overall efficiency of the education sector and help to develop management models and partnership arrangements to ensure the sustainability of the project outcomes. The Project will foster the use of the Internet, where possible, and communication among schools domestically and internationally. The Government, through its Samoa Development Strategy 2005-2007 (SDS) and Strategic Policies and Plan July 2006-June 2015 (SPP), is fully committed to achieving efficiency and quality goals in education and aligning the education sector with the national ICT strategy. \n\nThe Project will have four main components: (i) improving the quality of teaching and learning in secondary schools; (ii) improving access to education through ICT; (iii) establishing the Community Access Program and developing its partnerships; and (iv) strengthening education management and coordination, including improving analyses of economic efficiency, equity, and sustainability.\n\nThe Project will be implemented in two stages. This will allow the Government to assess the impact of SchoolNet and ICT on learning outcomes and postsecondary employment, and will contribute to strengthening the research and evaluation capacity of MESC. \n", "bounds": [[187.21741783900012, -14.05282968499999, 188.56230716200008, -13.46282317499994]], "name": "SCHOOLNET AND COMMUNITY ACCESS PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[346.2, -172.13333]]}}}
