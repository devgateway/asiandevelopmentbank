{"id": "46004-46392-001-GRNT0374", "info": "The proposed project will construct a 500-kV transmission line about 225 km long across the Hindukush mountain range between the northern town of Dashte Alwan and Kabul at the southern end. It will include a new 500-kV and 220-kV substation to connect to the grid in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. The project will add 1,000-1,300 MW to the existing 300 MW of transmission capacity between northern and southern Afghanistan. The new line will transmit electricity produced domestically by hydropower and fossil fuel generation in the country's northern region, as well as accommodate power imports from neighboring Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan to supply Afghanistan's domestic needs. The project will complement a second ADB power project under the proposed tranche 5 of ADB's Energy Sector Development Investment Program to build a 500-kV substation to connect to the grid at the northern end of the line in Dashte Alwan.", "bounds": [[60.48677779100012, 29.38660532600005, 74.89230676300014, 38.473673402000145]], "name": "NORTH-SOUTH POWER TRANSMISSION ENHANCEMENT PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[35.94458, 68.71512], [35.61527, 68.65967], [35.47093, 68.97287], [34.76782, 69.17192], [34.72843, 69.11738], [34.54807, 68.93637], [34.84288, 69.19813], [34.66382, 69.03642], [34.92794, 69.33321], [34.98448, 69.13412], [35.10862, 69.18465], [35.27398, 69.15827], [36.00118, 68.64001], [34.46666, 68.91667]]}}}
