{"id": "46004-37399-043-LN3034", "info": "The Green Power Development Project was approved on 29 October 2008. It includes two components: (i) hydropower development and (ii) rural electrification. Under the first component, the Dagachhu hydropower development (a 126 megawatt (MW) run-of-river type) aims to export power from Bhutan to India through the existing grid to India. The second component provides access to electricity in rural areas for around 9,000 rural households and public facilities on an on-grid and off-grid basis using renewable energy sources (i.e., hydropower and solar power). The project is to sustain the country s inclusive economic growth by promoting cross-border power trade and domestic electricity access in parallel. The power export revenue helps Bhutan sustain affordable electricity prices for rural households and generate additional government own resources to promote socioeconomic development in rural areas.\n\nThe original scope of rural electrification was already completed and the grant saving is being used to extend more electrification. For the Dagachhu hydropower component, 97% of ADB loans were disbursed except residual interest during construction. Almost 90% of the Dagachhu plant construction was completed;  the project is expected to be physically done by the original loan closing date of 31 December 2013. The overall project has been rated on track in the project performance rating. It is performing well and satisfactory in terms of technical performance, contract awards, disbursements, financial management, and safeguard compliance.", "bounds": [[88.73006677200013, 26.69614939400016, 92.08877648900014, 28.358398930786294]], "name": "GREEN POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - ADDITIONAL FINANCING", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[27.1, 89.86667]]}}}
