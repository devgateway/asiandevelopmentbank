{"id": "46004-44426-014-LN2787", "info": "To optimize transnational power supply and promote country-wide power transfer in an efficient manner, the Government aims to integrate regional power grid network systems, which comprise five interconnected electrical regions including northern, north-eastern, eastern, western, and southern. Each electrical region attempts to connect and synchronize power system of neighboring states within the region, but interregional power transfer capacity has still been limited. Since natural energy resources are unevenly distributed and concentrated in certain locations, surplus power from some regions can be transferred to other regions in power deficit only when creating  transmission super highways  among the regions. While the existing interregional transmission capacity stands at 22,400 MW, the Government targets to increase this capacity to 27,950 MW by 2012, growing to 57,000 MW by 2015, and 75,000 MW by 2017 under the 12th Five Year Plan. Such interregional transmission strengthening will create a backbone to sustain open power supply and investment in both generation and distribution.", "bounds": [[68.1434025400001, 6.74555084800015, 97.36225305200006, 35.49540557900009]], "name": "NATIONAL GRID IMPROVEMENT PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[27.25, 80.75], [30.91667, 75.41667], [23.5, 78.5], [30.0, 76.75], [29.0, 76.0], [28.65381, 77.22897], [22.03593, 82.64248], [29.91961, 76.96994], [21.5, 82.0]]}}}
