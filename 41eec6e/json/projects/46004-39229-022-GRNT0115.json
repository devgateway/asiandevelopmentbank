The Project will deliver these outputs through three components: (i) value-chain development under which it will establish a deposit account to guarantee 50% of the total amount of loans made by private commercial banks to agribusiness enterprises for value-chain development investment plans (selected by the bank from among a group of prequalified plans with high public goods elements), (ii) a local grant and infrastructure development facility to develop rural infrastructure and services, and (iii) project management. In a break with traditional approaches, the Project will provide private enterprises with resources to undertake value-chain investments that have typically been undertaken by public agencies.", "bounds": [[87.73570886300013, 41.58614491800003, 119.90702681500011, 52.129584046000076]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[47.0, 92.5], [45.5, 99.5], [46.25, 113.5], [49.66667, 106.41667]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT", "id": "46004-39229-022-GRNT0115"}
