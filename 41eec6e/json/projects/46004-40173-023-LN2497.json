{"info": "The Investment Program focuses on the Highlands core road network (HCRN) of 2,500 kilometers (km) of major national and some provincial roads, which carry the bulk of the traffic in the region. The investment program will include (i) projects to improve about 1,400 km of the HCRN, to be funded through four or more tranches under this multitranch financing facility (MFF); (ii) design and supervision of road improvement works, preparation and administration of long-term road maintenance contracts for the entire 2,500 km of the HCRN, and capacity development of road agencies; and (iii) monitoring the socioeconomic benefits of the improved and maintained roads in the Highlands region. Support will also be provided for policies such as road user charges (to increase the resources available for road maintenance). In addition, technical assistance (TA) will be provided to support the Department of Transport to prepare a new National Transport Development Plan (NTDP) for 2011-2020.", "bounds": [[140.84921106000016, -11.636325778999847, 155.96753991, -1.346368096999882]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[354.04498, 143.51381], [354.66667, 143.65], [353.71667, 142.83333], [354.52582, 143.12956], [353.95608, 143.54937], [353.66667, 143.33333], [353.81981, 143.4412], [354.33333, 142.5], [354.29433, 142.73661], [354.75, 144.0], [354.16667, 143.55], [354.13359, 143.50519], [354.15, 143.1], [354.15, 143.1], [354.12946, 142.91511], [354.62196, 143.38964], [354.61667, 143.16667], [353.88333, 143.66667], [353.82392, 143.65134], [354.01662, 143.3518], [354.66895, 143.79052]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "MFF-HIGHLANDS REGION ROAD IMPROVEMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM-PROJ.1", "id": "46004-40173-023-LN2497"}
