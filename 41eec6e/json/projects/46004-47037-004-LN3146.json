{"info": "In recent years Sri Lanka,has improved its energy sector and achieved a national electrification ratio of 94% (2012) as compared with 29% in 1990. However, a longer-term challenge is to reduce its high dependence on expensive fossil fuel energy. The energy sector struggles to (a) meet growing demand for electricity at a low cost and acceptable reliability rates, and (b) attain long term sustainability. The share of thermal oil-fired energy in the power generation mix has increased from 6% in 1995 to 59% in 2012 that creates a high energy cost base. Demand growth has been mostly met by expensive oil-fired thermal plants. This is not a viable and sustainable solution to the country s energy security and environment protection in the long term. Diversification of the generation mix primarily to renewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, reduced technical losses and supply and demand side management is the only way to correct this situation. The transmission network needs expansion and modernization, particularly in the former conflict-affected areas in Northern and Eastern provinces. The 33 kilovolt (kV) medium voltage (MV) network needs to expand power supply into rural areas where many households have poor reliability and inadequate quality of electricity supply. For sustainable functioning of the power sector, the government pursues financial, managerial, and institutional reforms in line with the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009.", "bounds": [[79.65577233200005, 5.92373281500015, 81.89031009200008, 9.829575914000145]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "MFF:GREEN POWER DEVT&ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPRVMNT INVSTMNT PROG-TR1", "id": "46004-47037-004-LN3146"}
