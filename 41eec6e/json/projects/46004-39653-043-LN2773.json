{"info": "The Project is to promote energy efficiency and environmental protection in Gungdong Province using advanced technologies, and is justified in technical, economic, and financial terms. The energy savings will result from retrofitting existing equipment with more efficient equipment, which in aggregate will reduce the need to construct and operate a conventional coal-fired power plant. The Project will consider only retrofits of proven energy efficiency technologies in the following areas: (i) motors and motor-drive systems; (ii) transformers and reactive power compensators; (iii) lighting; (iv) heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; (v) air compressors and pumping systems; (vi) recovery of waste energy from industry; (vii) coal-fired industrial boilers and industrial cogeneration; and (viii) other related energy efficiency improvement projects. The Project will have multiple benefits: (i) energy security improves as lesser new power supply capacity will be needed to meet future demand, and less coal will be used for power generation; and (ii) the local and subregional environment improves, and the contribution to global climate change is lower because of avoided coal use.", "bounds": [[73.6022563070002, 15.775376695000048, 134.7725793870002, 53.56944447900004]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[23.0, 113.0]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "MFF-GUANGDONG ENERGY EFFICIENY & ENVT IMPRVMNT INVSTMNT PROG-P3", "id": "46004-39653-043-LN2773"}
