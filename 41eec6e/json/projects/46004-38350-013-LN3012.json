{"info": "Nepal is a landlocked country.  More than 70% of the area is mountainous terrain. Road transport is central to economic and social development, accounting for almost 90% of the country's passenger and freight movement. Poor road connectivity is a major constraint for Nepal. Its road density is low-14 km per 100 km2 or 0.9 km per 1,000 people. The so-called strategic road network (SRN), with a total length of about 14,490 km of national and feeder roads, is the core of Nepal's roads system. It carries most of the country's road traffic and provides linkages to major economic centers and neighboring countries. This network consists of three main east-west corridors and several north-south corridors. The east-west corridors includes the EWH (1,024 km). This is the main artery in the country and the one with the heaviest traffic into the Terai region. The East-West corridors also comprise (i) postal roads running in parallel with the EWH along the Indian border to the south; and (ii) the Mid-Hill East-West Corridor (MHC), a series of feeder roads (1,700 km) that link mid-hill districts and the main centers in the hills, including Kathmandu and Pokhara.\nOnly 6% of the MHC is paved. The government wants to improve the entire 1,700 km stretch into all-weather maintainable standard. This will connect communities and provide access to basic services. There is also a need to improve north-south linkages between EWH and MHC.", "bounds": [[80.03028772000005, 26.343767802000087, 88.1690674240001, 30.416904195000086]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[86.66667, 1282836.0], [86.08768, 1282878.0], [87.88333, 1283047.0], [87.31667, 1283182.0], [86.0, 1283316.0], [86.80138, 1283439.0], [87.04607, 1283600.0], [88.07084, 7801902.0], [87.27385, 7943224.0], [87.99736, 7953899.0], [88.09753, 7954027.0], [86.62087, 7964862.0], [87.16179, 7997456.0], [87.17831, 7997518.0], [86.06899, 8533064.0]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "SOUTH ASIA SUBREG ECONOMIC COOPERATION ROAD CONNECTIVITY PROJ(SF)", "id": "46004-38350-013-LN3012"}
