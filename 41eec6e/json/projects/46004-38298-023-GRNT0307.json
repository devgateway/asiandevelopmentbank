{"info": "The project seeks to improve the quality and relevance of, and equitable access to and effectiveness of, the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system in the Kyrgyz Republic. Quality and relevance of the TVET system will be improved through modernization of the training methodology, teaching and learning environments, and training delivery. Equitable access will be improved through the introduction of an innovative skills development fund to provide training in response to urgent labor market needs, and for targeting specific geographic areas or specific groups to provide them with employable skills, such as out-of-school youths, ethnic minorities, and the disabled. The project also includes support to rural primary vocational schools outside of Bishkek and Osh, and better access for physically disabled students and for women. The effectiveness of the TVET system will be improved by strengthening TVET governance and management nationally and within the schools.", "bounds": [[69.22629602000012, 39.189236959000084, 80.2575606690001, 43.261701558000084]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[42.87, 74.59], [40.51506, 72.80826]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "2ND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT PR", "id": "46004-38298-023-GRNT0307"}
