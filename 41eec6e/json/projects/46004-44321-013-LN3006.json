{"info": "The Climate Resilient Rice Commercialization Sector Development Program (SDP) is proposed to support and accelerate the efficient and effective implementation of the Strategy on Agriculture and Water (SAW) and the  Policy on the Promotion of Paddy Production and Rice Export  (the Rice Policy). It will address food security and rice commercialization by prioritizing:  (i) strengthening the rice value chain; (ii) improving the legal and regulatory framework in agricultural land management; (iii) improving access to credit by paddy producers and rice millers/exporters; and (iv) enhancing paddy production and productivity through improved irrigation water use efficiency, establishment of paddy post-harvesting facilities, and paddy crop insurance pilots.  The SDP will (i) address major strategic thrusts of the 2011 2013 Country Partnership Strategy, and sector strategies and roadmap; and (ii) complement the on-going sector initiatives by emphasizing the commercialization aspects of rice.", "bounds": [[102.31342370600012, 10.415773620000081, 107.61051639900009, 14.704581605000087]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[12.63, 104.87], [12.78, 103.42], [13.27774, 103.09541], [13.23601, 102.8291], [12.66037, 103.40407], [11.0869, 105.37497], [11.53837, 105.43765], [12.91667, 103.08333], [12.89922, 104.48777], [11.75, 105.33333], [12.66667, 105.5], [11.36667, 105.46667], [12.48574, 105.12142], [12.9457, 104.51274], [11.12082, 105.48527], [12.83333, 105.0], [12.74245, 104.71999], [12.33333, 105.0], [11.74691, 105.40661], [12.40145, 105.10799]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "CLIMATE RESILIENT RICE COMMERCIALIZATION SECTOR DEV'T PROGRAM", "id": "46004-44321-013-LN3006"}
