{"info": "The Project will address sector constraints by rehabilitating existing irrigation facilities and, where appropriate, developing new ones, as well as rehabilitating and upgrading rural access roads from district centers and village cluster centers to villages. To enhance the impact of subproject investments, the project will support (i) technical extension services to subproject beneficiaries, (ii) producer groups to coordinate supplies of agricultural produce to markets and/or processors, (iii) contracted agricultural production with price incentives based on quality, and (iv) initiatives to secure tenure and access to land for sedentary agricultural production and land rezoning to protect the integrity of watersheds and reservoirs\nabove rehabilitated irrigation systems. This will contribute to improving agricultural productivity, diversifying crops, and commercializing the low-performing agriculture sector in the northern region. These investments will be complemented by (i) institutional capacity building for national, provincial, and district agencies towards a sector development approach and (ii) heightened awareness of gender issues and the participation of local communities in designing and efficiently implementing about 25 subprojects. The project will be implemented in the four northern provinces of Bokeo, Luang Namtha, Oudomxay, and Phongsaly, which have a combined population of 760,000 people, a third of whom are considered poor.", "bounds": [[100.0970732020001, 13.91545664500012, 107.66436324000011, 22.49604400700011]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[21.75, 102.33333], [20.16667, 101.5], [20.91667, 101.33333], [20.5, 100.5]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "NORTHERN RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT SECTOR P", "id": "46004-42203-022-GRNT0235"}
