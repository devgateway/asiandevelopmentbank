Also, it seeks to improve day-to-day management of health services by addressing (i) capacity constraints in the health sector, (ii) challenges in recruiting and posting motivated doctors and other professionals in rural and remote areas, (iii) rigid administrative procedures, (iv) inefficient and lengthy procurement processes for drugs and medical supplies, and (v) lack of performance monitoring.
