{"id": "46004-43452-022-GRNT0347", "info": "The proposed Tonga Outer Island Renewable Energy Project (the Project) will construct grid-connected Solar Photovoltaic (PV) power plants on the outer islands of Tonga, thereby demonstrating a method for reducing the country's heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels for power generation. The Project will supply secure, environmentally sustainable energy to households, schools, and other public facilities, on the islands of 'Eua, Ha'apai, and Vava'u.  The Project will quantify the solar resource and facilitate the integration of intermittent renewable energy with a conventional diesel grid.  The Project will build the capacity of the power utility, Tonga Power Limited (TPL), in the operation and maintenance of renewable technologies. Customers will be made aware of the importance of energy conservation and opportunities for passing cost savings to poor households by way of a subsidized tariff will be assessed during project preparation.", "bounds": [[183.78069095100005, -22.33879973799992, 186.0857446620001, -15.55950286299992]], "name": "OUTER ISLAND RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[341.33333, -174.0], [340.1, -174.41667], [339.75442, -174.80088], [344.04494, -173.77513], [344.403, -175.63703], [340.21667, -174.45], [340.33767, -174.29028], [338.6368, -174.92972], [340.05448, -174.70804]]}}}
