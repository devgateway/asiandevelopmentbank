It will support advanced teaching and learning programs that use information and communication technology (ICT), as well as prevocational and vocational programs, teacher development, and examination reforms. It will promote gender-equitable and pro-poor stipends for students. It will help establish more decentralized and efficient allocation and use of resources, as well as strengthen sector performance monitoring. The investment program will build upon the ongoing Secondary Education Sector Development Program  and the Second Teaching Quality Improvement Project.  It will further benefit from the experience of the Third Primary Education Development Project, which uses disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs).  The investment program links disbursement to the achievement of key results. It will further support the transition to a sector-wide approach.", "bounds": [[88.02178959200009, 20.73871491100003, 92.64285119700017, 26.623544007000064]], "name": "MFF:SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM-TRANCH1(SF)", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[24.0, 90.0], [25.0, 89.0], [24.16667, 90.41667], [22.91667, 91.5], [22.91667, 89.25], [22.5, 90.33333], [24.5, 91.66667], [25.83333, 89.0]]}}}
