{"id": "46004-39674-022-GRNT0123", "info": "The 500 kilometer (km) Bishkek-Torugart road is part of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Corridor 1 linking the Kyrgyz Republic with the People's Republic of China (PRC) and other Central Asian countries. The Torugart post is a major border control and customs facility between the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC. The road condition is poor; border-crossing facilities and procedures are outdated and inefficient, and they obstruct international traffic and trade. Improved road and customs infrastructure will remove the obstruction and open up this corridor for wider regional trade and economic cooperation. It will reduce travel and transit times from the current 3 to 4 days to 2 days. \n\nImprovement of the Bishkek-Torugart road will be implemented in three phases and includes (i) improving 488 km of the Bishkek-Torugart road in the Kyrgyz Republic and the 20 km Bishkek bypass road, (ii) modernizing infrastructure and facilities at the Kyrgyz Republic-PRC border crossing at Torugart, and (iii) policy and institutional support in the road subsector. The Project 1 outputs are (i) an improved 39-km road section from Km 400 to Km 439 of the Bishkek Torugart road, (ii) modernized customs infrastructure at the Kyrgyz Republic-PRC border crossing at Torugart, (iii) a transport sector master plan for 2010 2025, and (iv) a fully operational Bishkek-Torugart Road Corridor Management Department (BTRMCD).\n", "bounds": [[69.22629602000012, 39.189236959000084, 80.2575606690001, 43.261701558000084]], "name": "CAREC TRANSPORT CORRIDOR 1 (BISHKEK-TORUGART ROAD)", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[42.9, 74.63333], [41.17017, 75.81058], [41.16667, 75.8], [42.46017, 76.18709], [42.87, 74.59], [42.66667, 75.33333], [42.59496, 77.17805], [42.83349, 76.3326], [42.21667, 75.75], [42.21552, 75.75659], [41.5, 75.0], [41.42866, 75.99111], [41.56807, 76.27108], [42.84194, 75.30149], [42.09757, 76.57973], [40.55103, 75.31115], [42.636, 74.964]]}}}
