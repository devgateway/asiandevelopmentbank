This will provide substantially higher initial capacity of 10 Gpbs and reduce international connectivity costs by at least 50%. The submarine cable system will stimulate increased take-up of broadband internet, and lower the cost of telecommunications services. The infrastructure development under the project will be complemented by regulatory capacity development technical assistance from the Pacific Regional Connectivity Program (PRCP) of the World Bank.\n", "bounds": [[183.78069095100005, -22.33879973799992, 186.0857446620001, -15.55950286299992]], "name": "TONGA-FIJI SUBMARINE CABLE PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[341.85839, 178.44149], [341.91667, 178.33333], [338.86667, -175.2], [338.86062, -175.2018]]}}}
