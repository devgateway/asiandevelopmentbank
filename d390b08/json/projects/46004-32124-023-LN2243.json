It aims at scaling up the impact of the Project on PNG economic development and social integration by financing more road sections to improve road access to the private sector and communities, reduce their travel cost and time to major commercial and service centers, and enable them to tap economic and social opportunities in the Highlands region. It will support the Government's efforts to enhance export-led economic growth, generate income for local communities, and reduce poverty. The outcome will be increased economic activities and social improvement in the region.", "bounds": [[140.84921106000016, -11.636325778999847, 155.96753991, -1.346368096999882]], "name": "ROAD MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADING SUPPLEMENTARY", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[354.20005, 144.62797], [353.75, 144.83333], [353.83333, 145.08333], [353.5, 145.58333], [354.5, 143.5], [354.11667, 145.08333], [353.71177, 145.18436], [353.91664, 145.38735], [353.95, 145.38333], [353.75, 144.88333], [353.78333, 145.66667], [353.83333, 144.0], [354.46667, 144.56667], [353.61667, 143.83333], [353.58333, 145.91667], [354.16667, 143.55], [354.18333, 144.43333], [354.10141, 144.85294], [354.06667, 144.88333], [354.75, 144.0], [354.33194, 144.36616], [353.98333, 144.96667], [354.0, 145.0], [354.08333, 145.05], [354.5, 143.33333], [354.51082, 143.49078], [353.66122, 145.30441], [353.55, 145.25], [353.88333, 143.66667], [354.57945, 143.79236], [354.21228, 144.29179], [354.1419, 144.22744], [353.80224, 145.22509], [354.46667, 144.15], [353.81981, 143.4412], [354.2, 144.68333], [353.66667, 145.48333], [353.59371, 145.49037], [354.18333, 144.2], [353.36667, 145.5], [353.58333, 144.25], [354.52192, 143.70215], [354.66667, 143.65], [354.25, 144.25]]}}}
