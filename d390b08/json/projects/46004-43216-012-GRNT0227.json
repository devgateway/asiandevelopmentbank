{"id": "46004-43216-012-GRNT0227", "info": "The facility will assist the government's effort to ensure that critically important road and air transport projects are implemented efficiently by systematically advancing the preparatory activities. The facility will identify and prepare high-priority projects for potential funding by the government and or by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) or other development partners in the country. This preparation will include feasibility studies, safeguard due diligence, detail engineering design, bidding documents, and procurement assistance for advance contracting (if appropriate). This will contribute significantly to (i) improving the implementation performance of the ensuing projects by reducing the period between project concept and loan approval and the commencement of improvement works, (ii) helping to achieve the intended outcomes efficiently, and (iii) realizing the projects- impacts and benefits in a timely manner. The facility will also provide capacity development support to help establish an enabling environment, supporting the government's goal of developing transport infrastructure under public-private partnership (PPP). The facility will prepare transport projects that will contribute to improving connectivity and accessibility throughout the country. The facility is also relevant to ADB's sector strategy in support of the government's goal of achieving regionally balanced economic growth and reduced social inequalities.", "bounds": [[80.03028772000005, 26.343767802000087, 88.1690674240001, 30.416904195000086]], "name": "TRANSPORT PROJECT PREPARATORY FACILITY", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[28.0, 84.0]]}}}
