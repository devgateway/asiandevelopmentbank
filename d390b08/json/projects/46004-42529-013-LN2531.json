The Program will complement two planned ADB infrastructure projects (the Municipal and Urban Infrastructure Development Project and the Ajara Bypass Roads Project). The World Bank plans to provide $85 million in budget support through its Development Policy Operation. The European Union is also expected to provide budgetary assistance in the near future. The Program will support the following outputs. Output 1. Incremental expenditure needs arising from the worse-than-expected economic conditions in 2009 are met without complete drawn down of cash balances at NBG. Output 2. The delivery of the core Government expenditure program for 2009 in accordance with the approved budget, irrespective of subsequent revisions that take into account shortfalls in revenue.
