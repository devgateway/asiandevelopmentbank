{"info": "Brick manufacturing process is energy intensive and a main source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and fine particulate pollution in Bangladesh. The proposed project intends to establish an equivalent of $50 million credit facility in local currency at Bangladesh Bank (central bank) for relending to participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) to construct more energy efficient and environmentally superior brick kilns. The credit facility has two components: one is to upgrade existing polluting brick kilns to a transitional design as an immediate measure to comply with the government directive (footnote 11) and reduce pollution, and the other is to promote the most advanced brick kiln pilots to demonstrate their operational and commercial viabilities in Bangladesh. The combined efforts, along with concerted donor assistances, will help catalyze domestic finance and leverage the demonstrative effect to build up sizeable clean brick manufacturing capacity in Bangladesh to eventually replace the existing pollution brick kilns and modernize the brick sector.", "bounds": [[88.02178959200009, 20.73871491100003, 92.64285119700017, 26.623544007000064]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[24.0, 90.0]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "FINANCING BRICK KILN EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT", "id": "46004-45273-001-LN2865"}
