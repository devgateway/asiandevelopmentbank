{"info": "The Project will improve Papua New Guinea's (PNG) two-lane national road network by replacing narrow temporary modular steel (or Bailey) and other deteriorated bridges with permanent two-lane structures. The reusable Bailey bridges will be reassembled on rural roads to improve access. The Project is the first phase of the proposed bridge replacement program and covers five of the 16 priority national roads. It is envisaged that the Project scope will be expanded in future to finance subsequent phases of the bridge replacement program using Additional Financing Policy. The Project will develop capacity of the Department of Works (DOW) bridge asset management system (BAMS) and improve road safety awareness in rural areas of PNG where accident rate is high. The project preparatory work was undertaken through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) financed TA to PNG.", "bounds": [[140.84921106000016, -11.636325778999847, 155.96753991, -1.346368096999882]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[354.3551, 150.63584], [356.26667, 143.38333], [350.17708, 147.79656], [354.47357, 150.96796], [354.56667, 151.03333], [356.26265, 143.49411], [356.25526, 143.43744], [354.38268, 150.77692], [354.35541, 150.59094], [350.61434, 147.29764], [350.16694, 147.73639], [354.88333, 151.28333], [354.6, 151.03333], [350.8, 147.23333], [353.90069, 145.9671], [354.61667, 145.58333], [354.80334, 151.13393], [354.60761, 145.6467], [354.02196, 145.90019], [351.34488, 146.49678], [354.14149, 145.71256], [350.21332, 147.58638], [354.27756, 145.56102], [354.98333, 151.25]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "BRIDGE REPLACEMENT FOR IMPROVED RURAL ACCESS SECTOR PROJECT", "id": "46004-43200-024-LN2784"}
