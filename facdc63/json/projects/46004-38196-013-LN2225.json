{"info": "The project represents a 5-year time slice of Electricity of Viet Nam's (EVN) power transmission system development plan, covering 500 kilovolt (kV) and 220 kV transmission lines and associated substations. The project will transmit power from remote power plants to the northern part of Viet Nam, which is relatively poor. This enables adequate and reliable power supply required in the planned socio-economic development activities including new industrial parks. The Project will also create the potential for regional power interconnection.", "bounds": [[102.11865523300011, 8.565578518000152, 109.47242272200018, 23.366275127000122]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[21.33333, 105.88333], [21.15247, 105.81364], [21.25782, 105.84894], [20.84537, 105.87279], [20.5019, 105.50171], [20.66296, 105.03145], [20.60557, 105.23399], [20.4222, 105.62122], [18.98892, 105.57625], [18.8313, 105.62411], [19.22717, 105.64354], [19.02724, 105.43649], [21.41664, 105.23636], [21.19855, 104.9627], [21.35569, 105.00493], [21.01667, 107.3], [21.25042, 104.38501], [21.21667, 104.16667], [20.86611, 104.7245], [21.5296, 104.11113], [21.21412, 104.68993], [20.99995, 104.33417], [21.41206, 105.82432], [20.11481, 105.86839], [19.61376, 105.68279], [19.31667, 105.8], [19.82578, 105.58293], [21.79581, 105.17204], [21.32958, 105.39217], [20.66667, 105.33333], [21.16667, 104.0], [22.11667, 105.25], [20.98333, 106.51667], [20.81717, 105.33759], [20.8217, 105.97455], [20.74644, 106.03632], [18.67336, 105.69232], [20.27606, 105.75442], [21.44805, 105.30725], [21.3256, 103.91882], [19.79742, 105.72465], [19.8, 105.76667], [21.82356, 105.21424], [21.30561, 105.66225], [21.41878, 105.48496], [21.34698, 105.73757], [21.4569, 105.5946], [21.36189, 105.5569], [21.72288, 104.9113], [21.29444, 105.23134]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "NORTHERN POWER TRANSMISSION EXPANSION(SECTOR)PROJECT", "id": "46004-38196-013-LN2225"}
