{"info": "The project will contribute to Nepal s energy development objectives by (i) scaling up the on-grid and off-grid renewable energy supply, (ii) facilitating cross-border power exchange, (iii) increasing access to renewable energy in rural areas, and (iv) building capacity for on-grid and off-grid power sector development. The on-grid components will be able to evacuate 2,000 MW of new generation outputs along the Kali Gandaki corridor and Marsyangdi corridor to the main load centers at Kathmandu Valley, and facilitate at least 1,200 MW of power exports to India once the second 400 kilovolt (kV) cross-border transmission line from Bardaghat (Nepal) to Gorakhpur (India) is connected. Half of the exports will come from the Upper Marsyangdi 2 Hydropower Project, which is to be developed by GMR Group, India. The off-grid component will provide access to electricity and facilitate productive energy use activities in rural locations without connections to the national grid, increasing the income and welfare of rural communities by using renewable energy mainly for agriculture, rural enterprises, health, and education. The project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for Nepal, which aims to (i) improve inclusive electricity access, (ii) develop renewable energy, (iii) promote regional cooperation, and (iv) strengthen sector governance. The project is also prioritized as part of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program s Power Generation and Transmission Master Plan and Regional Cooperation Business Plan, 2014 2016. The sector and programmatic context of the project is presented in a supplementary document.", "bounds": [[80.03028772000005, 26.343767802000087, 88.1690674240001, 30.416904195000086]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "SOUTH ASIA SUBREGIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION PWR SYS EXPANSION PRO", "id": "46004-44219-014-LN3139"}
