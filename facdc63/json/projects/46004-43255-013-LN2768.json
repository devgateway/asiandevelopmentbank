{"info": "The Project forms part of the Government of Indonesia's ongoing flagship poverty reduction program the National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri), which was launched in 2006 with the commitment to reduce poverty by  adapting a community-driven development approach and providing direct support to poor rural and urban communities to improve essential social services and basic infrastructure. In line with the overall objective of the PNPM Mandiri Program, the expected outcome of the Project is improved access to service delivery and healthy livelihoods for the poor, near poor, and women in the project communities. The Project will have three outputs: (i) strengthened capacity for community planning and development; (ii) improved rural basic infrastructure through community development grants; and (iii) improved sanitation services through neighborhood development grants. The Project will be implemented in a geographic slice of the PNPM Mandiri Program and include about 600 rural communities in four provinces; and 1,350 poor urban neighborhoods in 34 cities.", "bounds": [[95.01270592500012, -10.922621351999808, 140.97762699400008, 5.910101630000099]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[352.25, 110.5], [357.25, 103.83333], [1.25, 124.83333], [0.5005, 101.749], [355.0, 105.0], [352.2606, 112.5099], [352.5, 110.0], [358.5, 103.0]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "URBAN SANITATION & RURAL INFRASTRCTRE SUPPORT TO D PNPM MANDIRI P", "id": "46004-43255-013-LN2768"}
