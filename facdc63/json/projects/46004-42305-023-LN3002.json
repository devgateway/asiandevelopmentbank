{"info": "The sequence of financial reforms in Cambodia has been guided by the Government's 10-year FSDS. A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for $850,000 ($700,000 from ADB TASF IV) was approved in April 2010 to help the Government update the FSDS 2006-2015 and formulate the next cluster program. IMF and World Bank have recently completed the first financial sector assessment program (FSAP) on Cambodia that will provide useful inputs to the update of the 10-year FSDS. While FSP I has been rated successful by the independent evaluation department (IED), some of the reform measures were not widely enforced due to weak interministerial coordination and capacity constraint. Prepared within the framework of the updated FSDS, the next program cluster (FSP III) will help complete some of the reform programs that commenced during FSP II, strengthen the enforcement of completed activities, and commence reform activities in leasing, capital market, and pension fund. The expected overall impact of the cluster program is a sound, market-based finance sector to enhance mobilization of financial resources to support sustainable economic growth. The expected outcome of the FSP III is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. FSP III was approved in November 2011. The National Bank of Cambodia will be the Executing Agency, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and Ministry of Commerce (MOC) will be the Implementing Agencies.", "bounds": [[102.31342370600012, 10.415773620000081, 107.61051639900009, 14.704581605000087]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[13.0, 105.0]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "THIRD FINANCIAL SECTOR PROGRAM-SUBPROGRAM 2", "id": "46004-42305-023-LN3002"}
