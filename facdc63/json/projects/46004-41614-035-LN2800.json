{"info": "Tranche 3 of the MFF investments will provide sustainable state power sector with increased distribution capacity to support inclusive and low carbon economic growth by (i) increasing the in-state power sales to match growing demand relative to 2008 baseline of 2,650 GWh meeting the demand increase as per the estimate for 2014, and (ii) improving the State Gross Domestic Product per capita relative to baseline of 2009 (Rs. 18,598 /capita).   The expected outcome of Tranche 3 will be the enhanced quality and expanded service delivery of electricity in Assam through improved technical, commercial, and financial performance and capability of the distribution utility by (i) indirectly helping Government of Assam s (GOA) Sector Road Map  of achieving village electrification and household electrification to 100%, and (ii) by reducing the system losses from 35% (6% Transmission, 29% Distribution) in 2008 to 19% (4% Transmission, 15% Distribution) in 2014.", "bounds": [[68.1434025400001, 6.74555084800015, 97.36225305200006, 35.49540557900009]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[26.22322, 91.65344], [24.66422, 92.86594], [26.38333, 91.96667], [26.08334, 89.96118], [26.35, 92.66667], [26.5, 91.4], [25.08333, 92.91667], [26.88184, 93.6156], [26.36558, 90.63477], [27.6091, 94.7942], [26.65725, 94.31529], [27.23517, 94.10357], [27.48905, 95.35992], [27.47989, 94.90837], [26.02966, 91.07973], [26.51166, 93.95951], [26.16732, 91.72488], [24.6, 92.4]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "MFF-ASSAM POWER SECTOR ENHANCEMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM-TRANCHE3", "id": "46004-41614-035-LN2800"}
