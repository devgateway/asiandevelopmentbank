Trimmu and Panjnad Barrages Project (TPBP) will rehabilitate and upgrade the Trimmu and Panjnad barrages on the Chenab River, which supply irrigation water to 1.74 million ha through six main canals. The project will (i) rehabilitate and upgrade the two barrages, and (ii) build institutional capacity in flood risk management. Trimmu barrage is located downstream of the confluence of Jhelum and Chenab rivers. Its flood passing capacity (FPC) is reduced from originally 18,265 cubic meters per second (m3s-1) to 12,743 m3s-1. The project will enhance the FPC to 23,220 m3s-1. Panjnad barrage is located downstream of confluence point of Sutlej and Chenab rivers. The project will enhance the barrage s FPC originally, from 19,822 m3s-1 to 24,495 m3s-1.", "bounds": [[60.8443787030001, 23.694525458000058, 77.0489709880002, 37.054483541000096]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "TRIMMU AND PANJNAD BARRAGES IMPROVEMENT", "id": "46004-47235-001-LN3159"}
