{"info": "In partnership with Government and other donors, the Project is expected to contribute over the long term to increased levels of educational attainment among new entrants in the workforce, and increased rates of formal employment and household incomes. The medium-term outcome of the Project will be improved quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of madrasah education at primary, junior secondary, and senior secondary levels. Key success indicators will include (i) improved progression and retention rates within the madrasah system; (ii) improved student performance at all levels, including reduction in the quality gap between the madrasah and general education systems; (iii) reduced district level disparities in student performance in the madrasah system with significant improvements in project madrasah; and (iv) more positive community perceptions of madrasah education quality.\nThe overall project design rationale is to combine a carefully selected set of supply-side interventions, alongside a number of key governance and institutional reforms. The selection of these interventions and reforms is based on extensive evidence of key determinants of quality and internal efficiency improvements. A second dimension of the design rationale is to focus these interventions on poor rural districts with significant concentrations of medium-sized private madrasah, taking account of the need to avoid duplication with other donor supported initiatives.  \nThe design is based on well-researched district and school selection criteria and significant stakeholder consultations.", "bounds": [[95.01270592500012, -10.922621351999808, 140.97762699400008, 5.910101630000099]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[355.66667, 120.25], [352.2606, 112.5099], [352.5, 110.0]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "MADRASAH EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT", "id": "46004-37475-013-LN2294"}
