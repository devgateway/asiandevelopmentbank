{"info": "The project will enhance the competitiveness of towns along the Southern Economic Corridor (SEC). The project will transform the corridor towns of Battambang, Bavet, Neak Loeung, and Poipet in Cambodia into economic hubs by improving urban-environmental infrastructure and strengthening institutional capacities of provincial and local authorities. The productivity of economic enterprises in these towns will be significantly improved since there will be increased climate resilience through flood control measures. The environment will be improved through clean wastewater, disposal of solid waste, and enhanced mobility on improved urban roads. The project will provide environmental infrastructure for wastewater treatment and solid waste management, which will, among others, help to reduce the carbon footprint of these towns, making them cleaner and greener, and more livable. The project will finance 10 subprojects in these towns.", "bounds": [[102.31342370600012, 10.415773620000081, 107.61051639900009, 14.704581605000087]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[11.06456, 106.13694], [13.65611, 102.5625], [13.10271, 103.19822], [11.25786, 105.27728]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "GMS SOUTHERN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR TOWNS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT(SF)", "id": "46004-43319-033-LN2983"}
