{"info": "The impact of the project will be improved economic development in areas downstream of reservoirs. The outcome will be the sustainable rehabilitation and management of reservoirs. The project will establish sustainable reservoir rehabilitation and management models for replication throughout the PRC, through a cycle of rehabilitation, management, monitoring, and evaluation of model reservoirs. It will have three components: (i) rehabilitation of model reservoirs, (ii) establishment of sustainable reservoir rehabilitation and management models, and (iii) project management support.", "bounds": [[73.6022563070002, 15.775376695000048, 134.7725793870002, 53.56944447900004]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[36.36278, 118.57389], [36.91056, 120.72583], [35.88583, 119.13778], [37.237, 122.16586], [35.5985, 117.296], [36.66333, 118.4575], [35.44722, 117.67389], [37.07113, 120.7395], [35.1095, 117.505], [36.8773, 118.113], [35.69827, 117.47629]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "RISK MITIGATION & STRENGTHNING OF ENDANGERED RESERVOIRS IN S.P.P.", "id": "46004-40683-013-LN2700"}
