ADB will finance part of the distribution investment program from 2007 through 2012. The impact of the distribution component will be more pronounced and apparent from the perspective of consumers. Improvements in voltage profiles will be evident through better lighting and fewer equipment failures. Supply will be available more consistently and momentary outages will be significantly reduced. The distribution component will also directly impact both technical and non-technical losses and eventually sector profitability and financial sustainability."}
