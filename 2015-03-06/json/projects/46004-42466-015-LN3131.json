It will support large-scale private sector involvement and public-private partnership, which is critical to meet existing and future labor market needs and to reduce the skills gap. This in turn is crucial for Bangladesh to move away from the 'low-skill, low-wage equilibriumm' to a 'higher skill, higher wage virtuous cycle' to become a middle income country. The program will help the government to scale-up skilling of new entrants and up-skilling of existing workers to contribute to higher growth of priority sectors. The program will strengthen skills development in Bangladesh and support transition to a sector-wide approach (SWAp) by establishing a unified funding system and enhancing overall coordination of the currently fragmented system."}
