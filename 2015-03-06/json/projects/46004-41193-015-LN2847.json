A functioning paved road network will help Mongolia to link together its large and poorly connected territory to promote social and economic development. The investment program will provide a vital link to economic opportunities and social services, reduce the high costs of imports, and improve the competitiveness of the region's export products. The physical elements of the investment program include (i) completing the western regional road, which has long been part of Mongolia's national development strategy, (ii) linking small villages and towns to the main corridor to spread the benefits of the investment to regional population centers, and (iii) establishing road maintenance centers to improve asset management and sustainability. Nonphysical components include capacity development in the road subsector, support for local contractors, extensive on-the-job training in project management and implementation, and sector reform initiatives adopted in the road map and implemented through coordination and performance links between the MFF and the parallel TA. The link between the MFF physical investments and the sector road map implementation will provide strong incentives for sector development and reform."}
