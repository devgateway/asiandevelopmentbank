Quality improvements include developing skill standards, improving curricula, and training teachers in four priority skill areas: (i) construction and building trades, (ii) mechanical and  machinery maintenance and repair, (iii) furniture-making, and (iv) basic business. Access and equity will be enhanced through the introduction of a voucher assistance training scheme and construction of dormitories. A key project focus is on increasing private involvement in TVET and achieving greater alignment between TVET and labor market needs. "}
