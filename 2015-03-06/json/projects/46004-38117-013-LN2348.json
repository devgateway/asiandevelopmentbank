To achieve this, the Project aims to reduce the prevalence of underweight in children under five years of age, and pregnant and lactating women through strengthening the capacity of central and local governments in improving the management of nutrition services. Strengthening community-based services for children and women, and social mobilization for improved nutrition and hygiene is the centerpiece of the Project. \nThe Project is expected to cover about 4,000 villages in 18 districts, including poor urban areas in 6 cities, in 6 provinces.  The participating provinces were selected and agreed upon between the Government, ADB and major stakeholders based on the following criteria: (i) prevalence of malnutrition, (ii) poverty incidence and (iii) local government commitment to contribute counterpart funding.  The Project is expected to have a demonstration effect, which may lead to an expansion of nutrition interventions to other provinces. \n"}
