The successful implementation of the UPEHSDP will help reduce child mortality and morbidity by reducing the prevalence of waterborne and food-related diseases, increase productivity by reducing overall morbidity, and improve the quality of life of urban inhabitants. UPEHSDP will improve the health status of the poor in urban areas and assist Bangladesh to make progress on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) relating to child and maternal health care and communicable diseases (MDGs 4, 5, and 6), and improve urban sanitation (MDG 7). The program and project loans under the UPEHSDP are designed to complement each other in achieving progress towards these key goals."}
