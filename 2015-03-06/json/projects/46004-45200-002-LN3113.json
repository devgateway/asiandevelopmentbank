Improved public transport will facilitate connectivity and greatly enhance access to transport services in five districts of HCMC, as well as support the HCMC Urban Transport Master Plan (HUTMP) objective of increasing public transport usage to over 40% of demand and reducing dependency on private vehicles. The Project will provide infrastructure for improving accessibility to MRT2 stations, implement feeder bus links, integrated multi-modal stations with \"park and ride\" facilities where appropriate, infrastructure for improving accessibility to MRT2 stations as well as a parking plan for the city. Project management and institutional capacity building measures, together with expected policy and regulatory reforms, will also help achieve an improved public transport system and reduce GHG emissions. The project components, public transport services and other facilities will be designed to incorporate gender sensitive features that will compliment similar measures under the MRT2 project."}
