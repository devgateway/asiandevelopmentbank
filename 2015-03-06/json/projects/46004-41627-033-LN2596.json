Harnessing this hydropower is vital to meet all in-state electricity demand by providng affordable, reliable power to its residents, as the state currently meets only about 50% of its power demand through its own power generating capacity.  Harnessing this hydropower will also enable the export of excess power to the rest of the country for the benefit of poorer and power deficient states.  Himachal Pradesh's focus on clean energy development will provide jobs to state residents and will furher the country's goal of meeting its energy through clean, indigenous sources."}
