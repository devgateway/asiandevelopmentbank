The expected outcomes of the Investment Program will be an improved urban environment and better living conditions for the 1.4 million people expected to be living in the Investment Program cities by 2017. To this end, the Investment program will (i) improve and expand urban infrastructure and services in the cities including in slums and (ii) strengthen urban institutional, management, and the financing capacity of the institutions, including the urban local bodies. The Investment Program will ensure that the benefits from investments are enjoyed by the poor, women and all other vulnerable groups, and that any negative environmental and social impacts are alleviated.
