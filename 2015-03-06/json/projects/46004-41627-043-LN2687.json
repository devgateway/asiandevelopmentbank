Investment Program-Trnche", "id": "46004-41627-043-LN2687", "info": "Himachal Pradesh is a mountainous state with abundant water resources in the five major rivers flowing through the state from the western Himalayas. The power generation potential of Himachal Pradesh is about 23,000 MW about one fourth of India s total hydropower potential out of which about 6,480 MW has been developed. Recognizing the state s comparative advantage in hydropower generation, the main strategy of the Government of Himachal Pradesh (GOHP) is the development of Himachal Pradesh as the  hydropower state  of India. Harnessing this hydropower is vital to meet all in-state demand by providing affordable, reliable power to its residents as the state currently meets only about 50% of its power demand through its own power generating capacity. Harnessing this hydropower will also enable the export of excess power to the rest of the country for the benefit of power deficient states. Himachal Pradesh s focus on clean energy development will provide jobs to state residents and will further the country s goal of meeting its energy needs through treading a low carbon path. Furthermore, the Program will meet capacity development needs to further improve the state s power sector."}
