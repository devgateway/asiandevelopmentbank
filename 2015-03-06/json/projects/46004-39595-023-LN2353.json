The Project provides for the construction of four units of 250 MW circulatory fluidized bed (CFB) generating units and the common facilities for another 1,000 MW to 1,200 MW installed generating capacity utilizing domestic coal as fuel. This constitutes as Phase 1 of the first stage development program envisaged to establish in two phases and increase the generating capacity of this new power station to 2,200 MW. The 2,000 MW Mong Duong Thermal Power Project will a mine mouth based power plant.\n\nThe Project will include all works and equipment required for the development of 250 MW x 4 units of CFB generating units. The Project will consist of the following components:\n\n(a) civil works for site preparation and common works, namely:\n(b) foundations, the power station building and cooling water circulation and other systems;\n(c) 250 MW x 4 CFB coal-fired CFB boiler complete with all auxiliaries;\n(d) two reheat steam turbine generators each with a rated capacity of 500 MW, complete with auxiliaries;\n(e) instrumentation and control systems;\n(f) coal and ash handling systems;\n(g) water treatment and other miscellaneous mechanical plants;\n(h) transformers, switchyeard equipment and other miscellaneous electricial equipment; and\n(i) consulting services\n"}
