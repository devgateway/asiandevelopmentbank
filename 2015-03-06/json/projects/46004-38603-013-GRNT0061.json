Its outcome is for the debt-restructured cotton farms in Vose and Yovon raions of Khatlon and Mastchoh and Zafarabad raions in Sughd to sustainably improve their financial viability based on market principles. \n\nThe Project will provide three key outputs to achieve the desired outcome. The two key outputs in the four selected cotton-producing raions are that (i) the strategies, policy measures, and mechanisms to effectively address and resolve indebtedness of cotton farms are in place; and (ii) participating commercial banks (PCBs) provide suitable financing products and services to the debt-restructured cotton farms.  At the supply chain's marketing level, the Project's third output is putting into effect grading and marketing regulations, a joint venture established by the Government with an internationally recognized cotton classification organization, and bonding warehousing of cotton following international standards.  To support the delivery of the outputs, an effective Common Center for Project Management will be established."}
