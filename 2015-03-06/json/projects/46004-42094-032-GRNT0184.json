The project provides about 29.5 kilometers of double circuit 200 kV transmission line from Chimtala S/S to the new Kabul South S/S (with 2x40 MVA transformers) which will form part of the national grid connecting NEPS to SEPS. It is expected that 65 km of medium voltage (20kV) and 500 km of low voltage (0.4kV) overhead distribution lines will be used.\n\nThe Project will assist rehabilitation and expansion of power transmission and power distribution system in Kabul. The city of Kabul has witnessed exponential growth in power demand (some 25% each year) and there is a critical need to expand power infrastructure to utilize imported and indigenous power flowing into Kabul. The project will also provide capacity support to the power utility -- Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS)."}
