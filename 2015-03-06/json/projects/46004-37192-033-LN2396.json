The transmission network, the power system's backbone, requires renovation and expansion in order to meet the objective to supply reliable and high-quality power and meet rising demand from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic customers.  Investments under the project will continue to address the immediate priorities of the primary transmission system improvement, dealing with the capacity shortfalls that currently result in regular system outages and supply interruptions to customers.  These investments are consistent with the Government's strategy to achieve the following outcomes: (i) a more efficient power system; (ii) high-quality power supply through a more reliable and stable system; (iii) greater geographic coverage of power supply; and (iv) greater access to affordable electricity, by bringing hydroelectric and coal-fired thermal energy to load centers."}
