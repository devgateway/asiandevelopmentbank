If these constraints are not removed, sound fiscal management and increased economic resilience will not be achievable. Possible government responses comprise fiscal, structural, and social policy measures, supported by prudent monetary policy.\nThe government will need budget support to (i) protect essential social expenditure for segments of society most adversely affected by the crisis, and (ii) advance structural reforms to improve medium-term competitiveness and productivity.\n"}
