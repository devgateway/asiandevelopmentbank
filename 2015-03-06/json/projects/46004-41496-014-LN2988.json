In Viet Nam, the GMS-SCC runs from the Cambodia border south through Kien Giang and Ca Mau provinces to Ca Mau city on sections of national highway (QL) 80, QL61, and QL63. The project area in Vietnam includes the provinces Kien Giang (population 1.63 million) and Ca Mau (population 1.20 million). Implementation of the Viet Nam component will be undertaken under two or more stages because of funding constraints. Funding is currently available for stage 1 of the GMS-SCC Project, which includes improvement of a short section of QL80 between the border at Xa Xia and Ha Tien, and completion of the transport corridor to Ca Mau on the Minh Luong Ca Mau city section. Improvements to be funded under future stages will include improvements to the Ha Tien Rach Gia section of QL80 and a bypass to Rach Gia."}
