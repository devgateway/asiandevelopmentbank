It will be phased as follows: (i) $84 million for Project 1 in 2012 and (ii) $80 million for Project 2 in 2013, both focusing on reducing NRW and improving water service efficiency in Colombo; and (iii) $100 million for Project 3 in 2015; and (iv) $36 million for Project 4 in 2016, both of which will include improvements in wastewater services and expansion of the water supply and wastewater services to other areas of Greater Colombo. A similarly phased approach will be taken within the tranches and in NRW reduction efforts. NRW reduction will be tackled first in areas with greater physical and commercial losses, and therefore requiring more critical investment in infrastructure replacement. These include Mattakkuliya, Modera, Kotahena, Grandpass, and Bloemendal in Colombo North Area; Fort, Slave island, Kollupitiya (part), and Union Place in Colombo Northwest Area, and Welikada, Boralla, Dematagoda, Maligawatta (part), and Maradana in  Colombo Northeast Area. These areas will be covered by the first tranche. During this period essential studies and modeling under the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) master plan will also be conducted to inform subsequent tranches."}
