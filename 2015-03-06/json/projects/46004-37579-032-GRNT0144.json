However, the capacity to apply sound management principles and practices are still deficient, particularly in view of increasing devolution of management responsibilities to the provinces.\n\nThe Project will address institutional and capacity building requirements (including governance improvements) to enable improved management of the sector on a sustainable basis while contributing to the Government s overall objectives of enhancing agricultural productivity, promoting commercialization of agriculture, and protecting the country s natural resources. Project outputs comprise (i) capacity built in sector management, (ii) investment in resource management and productivity enhancement, and (iii) an effective project management structure.\n"}
