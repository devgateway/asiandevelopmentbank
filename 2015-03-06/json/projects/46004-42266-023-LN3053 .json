The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working with KMC since 2000, but only regarding sewerage. The partnership has yielded good results. KMC has a strategy, sector road map, policy framework, and investment plan to address gaps in operational efficiency, institutional effectiveness, policy, and sustainability. The investment program combines physical and other investments. KMC wants ADB to continue its role as a key financing and advisory partner. The Project proposed for financing under the Periodic Financing Request will deliver three outputs: (i) Inefficient water supply assets rehabilitated; (ii) Sewerage and extension to peripheral areas continued; and (iii) Financial and project management capacity further developed."}
