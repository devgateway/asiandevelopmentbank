Under the first component, the Dagachhu hydropower development (a 126-megawatt [MW] run-of-river type) aims to export power from Bhutan to India through the existing grid to India. The rural electrification component will provide access to electricity sourced from hydropower to 8,767 households and facilities with grid extensions, and electricity sourced from solar energy to 119 remote public facilities (e.g., schools, health clinics, and other community facilities) on an off grid basis.\n\nThe Dagachhu hydropower development will be promoted by a joint venture company between Druk Green Power Corporation (DGPC) in Bhutan and Tata Power Company (TPC) in India through a public private partnership (PPP). The rural electrification component will be mainly served by Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC), a public utility service company.\n"}
