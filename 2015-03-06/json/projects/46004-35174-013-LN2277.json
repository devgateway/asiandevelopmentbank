ESP I aims at achieving: (i) improved policy interventions in primary and basic education and performance targets under the Nepal Education for All (EFA) 2004-2009, and (ii) a broadly accepted and financed 1-12 school sector reform and restructuring framework, for implementation by FY2010. ESP I will support  EFA by joining the Joint Financing Agreement (JFA). It will help finance the three remaining years of EFA, and help monitor, assess and improve policy implementation under EFA jointly with other pooling donors. Furthermore, ESP I will support the Government's ongoing process of preparing a policy, governance, management, and financing framework appropriate for an integrated 1-12 school sector. This support will be provided in a joint and harmonized manner with other donors in the context of a program based approach."}
