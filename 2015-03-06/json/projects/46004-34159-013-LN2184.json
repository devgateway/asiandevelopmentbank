The Project includes components to rehabilitate 1,266 km of deteriorated road links and replace 21 bridges on the Trans-Sumatra Central and Eastern corridors and Trans-Kalimantan Highway, linking producing areas and markets in the country's two largest islands. To ensure that the rehabilitated roads do not deteriorate prematurely and secure sustainable benefits, the Project will also include measures to reduce pavement damage caused by overloaded trucks, strengthen the planning, programming and execution of maintenance, and reduce the risk of accidents among roadside communities by raising levels of awareness of accident risk."}
