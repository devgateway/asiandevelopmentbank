The immediate outcome is to improve livestock productivity and profitability under integrated upland farming systems through (i) enhanced productivity of village livestock systems, (ii) capacity building for community driven development (CDD), and (iii) support for implementation management. The Project will contribute to sustainable livelihoods through improved cash incomes, food security, and nutrition for some of the poorest segments of the population. It will achieve this by providing access to appropriate  technology,  management and marketing systems, rationalizing household labor requirements, and improving returns to labor. It will contribute to gender equity by providing upland ethnic women with opportunities and support to participate in the selection and implementation of community and household investments in livelihoods improvements. It will support organization of village communities into small groups, training in credit management, and technical training in livestock rearing. Women will participate equitably in all training, group formation, and activities aimed at improved extension, production, and marketing. Environmental benefits are expected from the stabilization of shifting cultivation, improved hygiene, introduction of cut-and-carry systems, and environmental health through waste management, disease control, and controlled animal movements.  The project has the following outputs: (i) Improved on-farm livestock production technologies; (ii) Developed market efficiency and livestock enterprises; (iii) Strengthened participatory extension networks; (iv) Effective community driven development and (v) Strengthened project implementation management."}
