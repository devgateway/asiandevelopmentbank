It will finance the construction and upgrading of about 58 km of main canals (the north and south main canals of the Northern Chu and Southern Ma Rivers Irrigation System--NCSMRIS) and lower order canal distribution systems to supply existing pumped irrigation schemes which presently draw water from the Chu and Ma rivers. It will also to develop presently rainfed areas to serve an irrigation service area of about 23,900 hectares. The project will support capacity building of the irrigation management companies and water user associations to improve operation and management (O&M) of the irrigation system, and provide extension services to farmers. The project will benefit about 120,000 farm families. The government has agreed to comply with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement for the whole investment program to strengthen the application of social and environmental safeguard procedures."}
