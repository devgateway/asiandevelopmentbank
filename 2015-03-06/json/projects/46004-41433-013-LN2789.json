These provinces have high rates of poverty and large ethnic minority populations. The road network consists predominantly of mountainous, unpaved, narrow roads, and many sections are impassable during the rainy season. Project roads have been selected through project preparatory technical assistance (TA)  based on social and economic indicators  to maximize development benefits and impacts. The time and cost of traveling from mountainous remote areas to social infrastructure will be reduced, and the economic activities along the roads will be increased. The project is consistent with the strategic priorities of the country strategy and program, which emphasizes investments in infrastructure development for pro-poor economic growth."}
