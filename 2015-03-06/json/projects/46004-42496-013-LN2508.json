The project will rehabilitate and reconstruct 354 high-priority earthquake damaged roads in the nineteen worst-affected counties of Sichuan Province and 10 subprojects in the four worst-affected counties of Shaanxi Province. The project will rehabilitate and reconstruct 12 high-priority earthquake-damaged education facilities in the three worst-affected counties in Shaanxi Province. These components are designed to be mutually supporting in achieving the overall objective of restoring the affected communities' access to infrastructure to pre-earthquake levels, and ensuring restored infrastructure is in strict compliance with the latest seismic code."}
