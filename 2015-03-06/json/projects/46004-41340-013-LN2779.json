AEM will allow appropriate accounting for every unit of power consumed, which is essential for minimizing commercial losses and identifying upgrades that would result in a lower technical loss. The project will contribute to improving energy efficiency, and will help reduce commercial losses and improve collection efficiency of electricity revenue."}
