The project objective is to enhance regional power trade by (i) rehabilitating and improving 11 existing substations, and (ii) constructing a new substation.\n\nThe project impact will be the contribution to expanding Georgia s power trade in the Caucasus region. Net power exports are expected to increase from 10% of domestic power generation (2011) to 20% by 2019.  The project outcome will be a reliable, stable and efficient power operation system to meet increasing demand for power export and transit.\n\nThe project outputs consist of the following components:\n(i) Substation rehabilitation and improvement. Rehabilitate 11 existing substations by installing modern digital control and relay protection systems to achieve full functions of the existing supervisory control and data acquisition system and energy management system for efficient power dispatching operation.\n(ii) Khorga substation. Construct a new 220/110 kV substation with 220 kV and 110 kV line bays and associated equipment.\n(iii) Project supervision and management. Provide assistance to GSE for project supervision and management.\n(iv) Study of potential hydropower investment projects. Help the government conduct necessary feasibility studies and due diligence assessments of safeguards on future potential hydropower investment projects.\n"}
