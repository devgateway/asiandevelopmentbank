Completion of this national road provides an alternative north south transit route from Mazar-e-Sharif to Kabul from the currently overloaded Salang Tunnel, a facility which has exceeded its engineering design life and is in need of major rehabilitation if it is going to continue to function. Additionally, Tranche 3 will provide community infrastructure specifically designed to improve the lives of women and children in some of Afghanistan s poorest provinces, Bamyan and Samangan, through betterment of sanitation facilities and practices."}
