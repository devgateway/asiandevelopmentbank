ADB will finance key components of the transmission investment program from 2007 though to 2012. The construction of new transmission lines will remove constraints to power flow and will provide additional operational flexibility to TRANSCO in its role as independent system operator in MP. Supply reliability will be further improved and furthermore, it will promote open access and development of intra-state and inter-state power trading by probiding sufficient excess substation and line capacity to handle unplanned power transfers."}
