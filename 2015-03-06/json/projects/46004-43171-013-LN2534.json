It focuses on urban transport, but could flexibly respond to other municipal infrastructure. It will provide (i) proceeds to MDF for financing to selected municipalities for repairing and rehabilitating municipal infrastructure and local utility services, and (ii) capacity development for MDF and municipalities through incremental administration and technical assistance programs.\n\nThe MSDP 2 follows the Municipal Services Development Project (MSDP 1) approved in August 2008. It targets high-priority urban transport projects in Tbilisi and other municipalities, which were proposed for additional Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing under the MSDP 1. As available financing under the MSDP 1 is largely committed to other priority investments, a new facility is proposed."}
