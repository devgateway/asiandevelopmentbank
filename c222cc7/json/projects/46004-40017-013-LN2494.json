{"info": "Most of the water management problems in the People's Republic of China (PRC), particularly for coastal cities, are the result of a fragmented approach to development. There is a need to move towards a more integrated management approach whereby the different tasks associated with water management (water supply, wastewater management, drainage) and ecosystem rehabilitation are managed together in close coordination with land use planning, coastal zone management and water resource management, and pollution control at the river basin level.  To reduce pollution in the country's coastal waters and sustain ecosystems, a number of specific actions are needed, including (i) adopting a holistic approach to water management in river basins and coastal zones, (ii) reducing land-based pollution sources particularly industrial and urban point sources, and (iii) continuing institutional and financial management reforms to facilitate sustainable environment management.", "bounds": [[73.6022563070002, 15.775376695000048, 134.7725793870002, 53.56944447900004]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[41.51998, 113.26468], [36.63167, 120.26861], [36.13722, 120.24417], [36.28389, 120.00333]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "QINGDAO WATER RESOURCES & WETLAND PROTECTION", "id": "46004-40017-013-LN2494"}
