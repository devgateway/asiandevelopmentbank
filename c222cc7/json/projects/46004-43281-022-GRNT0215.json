{"info": "The Study will provide consulting services for each of two major engineering design specifications: (i) civil works on geological risk ssessments, and (ii) facilities on technical and hydrological risk assessments. It is essential for hydropower development to clarify the project's uncertain factors and to incorporate preventive actions and risk mitigation measures in the project design, prior to financing decisions and implementation. To minimize project risks, the Study will focus on geological and hydrological assessments through rock tests and hydraulic model simulation to establish engineering design parameters.", "bounds": [[80.03028772000005, 26.343767802000087, 88.1690674240001, 30.416904195000086]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[27.96544, 84.27862]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "DETAILED ENGINEERING STUDY FOR THE UPPER SETI HYDR", "id": "46004-43281-022-GRNT0215"}
