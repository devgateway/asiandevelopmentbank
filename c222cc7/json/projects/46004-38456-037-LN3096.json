{"info": "The project comprises physical investments in subprojects covering (i) secondary transmission grid (STG): augmentation and extension of 132-kV power transformers at existing substations; (ii) energy loss reduction and distribution of power: replacement of overloaded distribution transformers with higher capacity and adding additional distribution transformer capacity on the 11-kV feeders; and (iii) strategic spares: spare power transformers for emergencies. The project will add 5,021 megavolt-amperes (MVA) of transformer capacity and will improve the distribution system' s efficiency and delivery.", "bounds": [[60.8443787030001, 23.694525458000058, 77.0489709880002, 37.054483541000096]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[31.03333, 73.13333], [30.76667, 72.43333], [31.82414, 72.79971], [31.9652, 72.70236], [31.9652, 72.70236], [31.50056, 73.26667], [31.45219, 72.46125], [30.73333, 72.65], [31.56781, 73.18347], [32.2898, 72.2813], [31.33333, 73.43333], [31.41667, 73.08333], [31.72, 72.97889], [31.56918, 72.64899], [31.55169, 72.23214], [32.27204, 72.90425], [31.62525, 71.06574], [31.77779, 72.59959], [31.30677, 72.32814], [31.06905, 72.93613], [32.27514, 72.90471], [30.97433, 72.48269], [31.35689, 72.88888], [31.611, 73.02672]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "POWER DISTRIBUTION ENHANCEMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM - TRANCHE 4", "id": "46004-38456-037-LN3096"}
