{"info": "The project will improve access to socioeconomic opportunities by rehabilitating and maintaining land, sea, and air transport infrastructure.  Solomon Islands has been offered significant parallel grant cofinancing from the governments of Australia and New Zealand but has insufficient capacity to plan and implement the necessary civil works. The project will therefore strengthen transport sector institutions by establishing a central project implementation unit (CPIU) to reform the government's institutional structure, implement civil works, and conduct technical and managerial capacity development. In doing so, the project will prepare an environment for a comprehensive transport sector-based approach based on long-term partnerships, sector coordination, and reliance on government systems. Through close cooperation with other development partners, the project will support the government in efficiently implementing all externally funded assistance to the transport sector.", "bounds": [[155.50798587300008, -12.290622653999918, 168.8258569670002, -6.599867445999806]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[352.0, 159.0]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "TRANSPORT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT", "id": "46004-41171-022-GRNT0243"}
