{"info": "The project will improve the quality of urban life in the capital city of Nepal by delivering a more efficient, safe, and sustainable urban transport system (UTS),2 favoring local economic growth and addressing climate change and air pollution mitigation. The UTS will be enhanced by focusing on (i) a plan to rationalize and upgrade the existing public transport network, tested through the implementation of pilot routes provided with electric vehicles; (ii) traffic management works and measures that will enable heritage routes in the city center to be pedestrianized and improve general walkability (general walking conditions); and (iii) improvement of air quality monitoring. The project aims to integrate these components holistically. The environment for development work has greatly improved since 2006, when the decade-long conflict ended. The experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has shown that active community participation can insulate development work from a country's wider challenges and thus bring\nabout effective service delivery. Consultations were undertaken with various stakeholders, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), relevant central government ministries and departments, public transport operators, and residents associations. The project design and implementation arrangements have fully taken into account the current political context in Nepal,3 with the implementation expected to proceed amid the ongoing peace process.", "bounds": [[80.03028772000005, 26.343767802000087, 88.1690674240001, 30.416904195000086]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[27.70169, 85.3206]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "KATHMANDU SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT (SF)", "id": "46004-44058-013-LN2656"}
