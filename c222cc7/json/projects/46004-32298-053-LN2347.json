{"info": "The distribution efficiency enhancement envisaged under this Project is to be undertaken in various distribution circles in the eastern, central and western zones and various locations across the State of Madhya Pradesh.  ADB financing will be used to partially fund distribution system investments to deliver power to consumers reliably, efficiently, and at a higher quality.  Improvement to voltage profiles will be evident through better lighting and fewer equipment failures.  Supply will be more consistent, and momentary outages will be reduced significantly.  Furthermore, technical and nontechnical losses will be reduced. This loss reduction will support achieving sector profitability and financial sustainability.", "bounds": [[68.1434025400001, 6.74555084800015, 97.36225305200006, 35.49540557900009]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[23.5, 78.5], [24.823, 79.144], [25.00921, 79.04778], [23.16697, 79.95006], [22.66667, 77.5], [25.28773, 79.33279], [26.22982, 78.17337], [26.2, 78.2], [24.5, 77.5], [24.75, 79.75], [24.62625, 79.49243], [23.25469, 77.40289], [23.5, 77.41667], [21.83333, 77.83333], [24.72868, 81.40886], [24.89747, 80.25894], [24.77795, 82.09684], [24.56412, 79.30712], [25.04282, 81.7281], [26.27923, 78.0709], [23.33339, 77.35254], [23.1478, 77.30085], [21.90648, 77.91389], [23.91667, 78.0], [24.75, 79.0], [24.98209, 81.64224], [24.83539, 81.36605], [25.5, 78.0], [23.25, 77.25], [24.58224, 80.8248], [23.84251, 78.74386], [23.75, 78.75], [24.75, 81.5], [23.63628, 79.06233], [24.89037, 79.91282], [23.83333, 76.75], [25.02023, 79.2318], [25.35145, 78.64071], [26.16667, 77.5], [24.66767, 81.54673]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "MFF-MADHYA PRADESH POWER SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM-TRANCHE 4", "id": "46004-32298-053-LN2347"}
