{"info": "The Project will work with both the national and the provincial governments. At the national level, the Project will help the Government strengthen sector planning and management by developing a sector strategy, a road map, and an investment program. A public private partnership (PPP) framework will also be prepared together with the sector strategy to enable the Government to promote private sector involvement in the sector more effectively. At the provincial level, the Project will provide safe, reliable, and sustainable water supply and improved sanitation services in seven districts and one city in Surkhandarya Province. The services can be used as a model that can be replicated and expanded in other provinces. Besides investments in physical infrastructure for system rehabilitation and necessary upgrading, the Project will address the critical planning, management, financial, operational, and customer relations needs of the vodokanals (water supply and sanitation agencies) to improve service delivery efficiency.", "bounds": [[55.975838663000076, 37.18514740000002, 73.14864058400016, 45.55871897400006]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[38.0, 67.5], [37.66833, 67.23389], [37.22417, 67.27833], [37.31667, 67.5], [38.0, 67.83333], [37.99944, 67.7875], [38.66667, 67.8], [38.41444, 67.95806], [38.0, 67.58333], [37.81528, 67.57889], [37.50889, 67.42333], [37.41667, 66.83333], [37.41667, 67.16667], [37.46222, 67.15056]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "SURKHANDARYA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT", "id": "46004-40007-013-LN2466"}
