{"info": "The Project will build the first fixed crossing across the Padma River for road traffic comprising (a) a two-level steel truss composite bridge 6.15 km long, the top deck to accommodate a four-lane highway and the lower deck to accommodate a single-track railway to be added in the future; (b) 12.0 km of approach roads, 1.5 km on the Mawa side and 10.5 km on the Janjira side; (c) bridge-end facilities including toll plazas and service areas; and (d) river training with dredging and bank protection works, 1.5 km on the Mawa side and 12 km on the Janjira side, to regulate flow and prevent damage to the bridge structure. The Project will also have a component to develop cost-recovery mechanisms to ensure investment sustainability and to carry out institutional capacity building to ensure sustainable asset management.", "bounds": [[88.02178959200009, 20.73871491100003, 92.64285119700017, 26.623544007000064]], "locations": {"geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[23.33811, 90.32744], [23.33811, 90.32744], [23.39056, 90.5575], [23.39056, 90.5575], [23.46667, 90.26667], [23.46667, 90.26667], [23.46667, 90.26667], [23.55, 90.36667], [23.55, 90.36667], [23.55, 90.36667], [23.22096, 90.35105], [23.22096, 90.35105], [23.33811, 90.32744]]}, "type": "Feature"}, "name": "PADMA MULTIPURPOSE BRIDGE PROJECT", "id": "46004-35049-013-LN2701"}
