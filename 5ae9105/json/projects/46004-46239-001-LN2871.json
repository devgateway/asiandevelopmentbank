Learning from lessons learned from the 1997/98 Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) and the 2008/09 global financial crisis, the Government has introduced a number measures to safeguard against any major trade and financial impacts emanating from the current global economic situation. The proposed $500 million INO-PFF (a countercyclical support facility with a precautionary financing option) will enhance the Government s preparedness to address the potential adverse impact of increased volatility in the financial market, given the government s increased dependence on the market to meet its budget financing needs.  The Government has met the access criteria under ADB s guidelines for a countercyclical support facility: (i) continued good macroeconomic management; (ii) potentially significant economic impact (resulting, in this case, from a possible worsening in the eurozone crisis); and (iii) implementation of a countercyclical program in the revised 2012 budget.", "name": "PRECAUTIONARY FINANCING FACILITY"}
