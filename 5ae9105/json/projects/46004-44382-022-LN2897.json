The SCS will comprise an international spur into Guadalcanal (landing in Honiara) and two domestic spurs linking Guadalcanal with Malaita (landing in Auki) and the Western Province (landing in Noro). Jointly, these provinces are home to roughly 72% of the population. The SCS will provide onward cost-effective broadband access to the rest of the world, which will boost opportunities to set the country on an inclusive growth path through the expansion of business opportunities in the ICT sector and the introduction of broadband solutions to service delivery constraints in key social sectors like health and education.", "name": "BROADBAND FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT"}
