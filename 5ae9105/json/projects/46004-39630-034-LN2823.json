Subsequently, on 28 March 2008, ADB approved the MFF of an aggregate amount of $600 million to POWERGRID for the Investment Program.  Initially, the scope of the program comprised of two projects; Project 1: Upgradation of Transmission Capacity for Evacuation of Power from Uttarakhand, and Project 2: \u00c2\u00bf800 kV High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Northeastern   Northern/Western Interconnector.  However, due to the delay in commissioning of the associated hydropower generating facilities in Uttarakhand, POWERGRID decided to keep on hold the implementation of Project 1 until 2013.  As a result, it was decided that all ADB facility of $600 million under the MFF will be utilized to fund Project 2:  +800kV HVDC North East - Northern/Western Interconnector  in two tranches.
