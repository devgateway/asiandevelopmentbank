In order to ensure good quality, 24 hour power supply to rural households, Government of Madhya Pradesh (GoMP) has been undertaking a distribution improvement program (feeder separation program) with an approximate cost of $1100 million. The first phase of this program is already under implementation and the proposed Facility provides financial assistance to the investment program that constitutes the second phase. The investment program will install separate feeders  for households and irrigation water pumps, install high voltage distribution systems (HVDS), provide new power connections, install meters, map the assets of the distribution companies and undertake network analysis to ensure better quality power supply to households and financial sustainability of the distribution companies.  Of the total of 50 districts of MP, the investment program covers 32 districts served by three distribution companies: Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited (DISCOM-C); Madhya Pradesh Poorva Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited (DISCOM-E); and Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited (DISCOM-W).", "name": "MADHYA PRADESH ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT INVESTMENT PROG-T2"}
