Together with the ongoing improvement works in the other sections, it will enable all weather road travel between Bishkek and Kashi. Aside from the economic benefits of higher speeds and reliability, the better road geometry and protective structures resulting from the improvement will reduce the accidental toxic spill risk and material run-off from vehicles. These reductions will benefit the ecosystem of Chatyr Kul lake--a wetland of international significance and protected under the Ramsar convention. \n\nThe project will also strengthen infrastructure management skills of government staff engaged in the road sector. This is an essential and natural complement to the capital investment. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance for institutional strengthening and capacity building totaling nearly $6 million between 1996 and 2010. The World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have more assistance programmed for 2011. These are short and one-off interventions. The project, in contract, supports a long-term, results oriented program of learning and development for government staff. It will result in better informed staff, equipped to champion strategies for reducing life cycle costs and improving user cost recovery.", "name": "CAREC CORRIDOR 1 (BISHKEK-TORUGART ROAD) PROJECT 3"}
