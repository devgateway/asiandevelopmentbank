The bank-dominated financial sector cannot adequately finance the economy\u2019s investment needs. FSPL III will lead to an increased share of capital markets in the financing of domestic investment, which will promote and facilitate sustained high growth in the economy with reduced risks. Development of diversified capital markets will result in increased efficiency of financial intermediation in the economy, more efficient allocation of resources, and a sound macroeconomic environment that is more resilient to external and regional shocks. \nFSPL III will also support Government efforts to promote greater regional cooperation through cooperation with regulators of other securities markets in the region. The outputs of the subprogram 1 include: (i) enhanced market liquidity by lowering of transaction costs, (ii) institutional framework for securities issuance, (iii) investor and consumer protection, and (iv) improved regional cooperation in securities market regulation.\n", "name": "THIRD FINANCIAL SECTOR PROGRAM LOAN (SUBPROGRAM 1)"}
