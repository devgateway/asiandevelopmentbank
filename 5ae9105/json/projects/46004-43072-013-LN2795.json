High population density, poor hygiene practices and inadequate sanitation infrastructure have contributed to a high prevalence of waterborne disease among the local population and degradation of the natural environment. The proposed Project will support improvements to the health of communities in South Tarawa. This will be achieved through enhanced community engagement in, and public awareness of, hygiene and sanitation; rehabilitation and upgrading of sanitation infrastructure; capacity development to improve sector planning, and operation and maintenance of urban water supply and sanitation services; and the creation of a sanitation maintenance fund to ensure adequate financing for sanitation infrastructure maintenance. A project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is preparing the Project including the development of the Water Supply and Sanitation Roadmap 2011-2030 and associated investment plan, and required due diligence assessments.", "name": "SOUTH TARAWA SANITATION IMPROVEMENT SECTOR PROJECT"}
