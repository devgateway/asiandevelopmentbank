It will do this by strengthening national and local linkages in public financial management (PFM), mitigating fiduciary risks through greater transparency and public participation, modernizing procurement systems, and enhancing the effectiveness of oversight and accountability agencies. The program will support efforts by the Government of Nepal to reform budget, fiscal and fiduciary risk management at the subnational or local government level (district development committee [DDC], municipality and village development committee [VDC]), public procurement, and oversight and accountability institutions at the national level.  The program is aligned with ADB's Nepal country partnership strategy for 2010-2012, which seeks to enhance transparency and accountability, strengthen local governance, and increase the effectiveness of service delivery.", "name": "STRENGTHENING PUBLIC MANAGEMENT PROGRAM"}
