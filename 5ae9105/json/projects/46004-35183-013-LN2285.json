It focuses on the development of small-scale and low-cost aquaculture production systems that are economically sound and environment friendly, and that can be easily replicated by fish farmers organizations and small- to medium-scale private entrepreneurs. The Project will provide technical and extension support to fish farmers in order to ensure successful project implementation. Such support includes innovative mechanisms to assist organized fish farmer groups with securing production inputs and marketing their final product. The Project builds the capacity of the Directorate General of Aquaculture (DGA) and the participating district governments to formulate policies and regulations for sustainable aquaculture development and environmental management, and to support the needs of the beneficiaries, their communities, and the country's aquaculture industry as a whole.\n\nThe Project is implemented in five districts in four provinces: namely: (i) Langkat in North Sumatera Province, (ii) Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) in South Sumatera Province, (iii) Karawang and Sumedang in West Java Province, and (iv) Buton in Southeast Sulawesi Province.", "name": "SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE DEVT FOR FOOD SECURITY & POVERTY REDUCTIO"}
