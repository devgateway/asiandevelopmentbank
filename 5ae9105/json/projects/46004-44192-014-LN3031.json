The proposed interconnection includes about 112 kilometers of 400 kV double circuit transmission line between the electrical substations at Baharampur in India and Bheramara in Bangladesh, a 400 kV switching station at Baharampur, a 500 MW back to back high voltage direct current (HVDC) sub-station (400/230 kV) at Bheramara and associated infrastructure on both sides. The interconnection will facilitate an initial power flow of 500 MW into Bangladesh from the Indian electrical grid to partly address the significant power shortages in Bangladesh, with a provision to enhance the power flow subsequently to 1,000 MW. The Project consists of the Bangladesh portion of the interconnection. The additional financing will address the cost over-run and cover a part of the funding gap for the Project.", "name": "SASEC BAN-IND ELECTRICAL GRID INTERCONNECTION PROJ-ADD FIN(SF)"}
