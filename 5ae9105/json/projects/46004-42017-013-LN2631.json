It will improve the transport capacity of the province's East-West 2 corridor (Qiangfeng Farm-Nenjiang) by completing a key missing section between Yichun and Wudalianchi, improving the capacity of the existing road section between Longzhen and Nenjiang, and connecting these improved road sections to the other parts of the road network. This will complete the Yichun-Wudalianchi-Harbin tourism loop connecting prominent tourism destinations for forest tourism and geological scenery, and the provincial capital city. \nBy optimizing the road alignment and shortening the travel distance by 400 km, the project will help to develop a more resource-efficient transport infrastructure with significantly reduced energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and road traffic accidents.\n", "name": "SECOND HEILONGJIANG ROAD NETWORK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT"}
