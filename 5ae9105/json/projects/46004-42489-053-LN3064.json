There is one treatment plant covering these cities which was built in the 1970s and because of the aging infrastructure and inadequate maintenance the sewage treatment facility is only operating at 20% of its designed capacity. The treated sewage has high levels of pollutants. Sewage is discharged into the nearby river when the sewage treatment facility is non-operational. Due to frequent sewer breakage, the surrounding streets and land are highly polluted. Where expansion has occurred in the cities, these areas have not been covered by the sewerage system. The government has decentralized many WSS services to devolve greater ownership and responsibility to local level, but the success at the level of local water enterprises is limited, with little accountability and incentives to improve services. Vodokanal staff have had limited opportunities for upgrading their skills. Consumption of electricity is high. Improvements are required in O&M procedures, system maintenance, customer relations, collection rate, performance monitoring, and benchmarking systems. On 11 February 2013, the government submitted a periodic financing request (PFR) to ADB for Tranche 4, to finance rehabilitation and expansion of the sewerage system in Fergana and Margilan cities, and capacity development and project implementation support.", "name": "MFF:WATER SUPPLY&SANITATION SERVICES INVESTMENT PROGRAM-TRANCHE 4"}
