These priorities include (i) maternal and child health services, (ii) control of communicable diseases, (iii) services to improve access to basic health care, and (iv) referral services including laboratory and other diagnostic services. The Project will support DBP\u2019s Sustainable Health Care Investment Program, a credit facility established in 2007 to support the health sector reform agenda and implementation framework\u2014Fourmula One for Health (F1)\u2014of the Department of Health (DOH). The credit facility is available to local government units (LGUs), and the private sector through two windows (i) direct retail lending for LGUs and larger private sector subborrowers, and (ii) wholesale lending to accredited financial intermediaries (microfinance intermediaries, rural and thrift banks) for small private subborrowers. The Investment Program is financed from DBP\u2019s own resources and supplementary funds of development partners, and supports both capital investments and working capital. The Project\u2019s outputs are (i) upgraded LGU health services, (ii) more efficient health delivery systems through public\u2013private partnership (PPP) and innovative strategies, (iii) improved access to small-scale private providers, and (iv) enhanced institutional capacity for health sector lending.", "name": "CREDIT FOR BETTER HEALTH CARE PROJECT"}
