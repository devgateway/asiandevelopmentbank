To this end, SIPRP V will provide parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s poverty reduction support credits (PRSCs) 7\u20139 within the framework of the PRSC process. The Subprogram 1 will provide parallel financing with PRSC 7 and support actions included in its policy matrix. The Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and other development agencies participating in the PRSC process agreed on the policy matrix for PRSC 7 after a series of consultations in 2007 and in the first half of 2008. The policy matrix is based on the Government\u2019s reform agenda and includes a wide spectrum of policy actions in business development, social inclusion, natural resource management, and governance. The Subprogram 1 will focus on those actions in the policy matrix for PRSC 7 that complement policy actions supported by ADB\u2019s other program loans to Viet Nam or are otherwise important to ADB\u2019s operations in this country.
