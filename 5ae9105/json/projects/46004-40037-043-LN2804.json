The overall project will also help improve the livelihood of project-affected people and reduce the prevalence of HIV in Lae and surrounding localities. This involves financing (i) construction of port facilities including a tidal basin, a multipurpose berth, and terminal works; (ii) resettlement and livelihood improvement and social improvement for affected people; (iii) consulting services for project management, construction supervision, financial management, resettlement, and socioeconomic monitoring; and (iv) gender-responsive programs for HIV awareness and prevention. Current project implementation preconstruction activities are mostly complete, including the relocation of 3,200 people from the project site. \n\nAs a result of input price increases, the devaluation of the US dollar against the kina, and design modifications, the total current project cost has increased from $154.0 million at appraisal in 2007 to $291.4 million in 2011. The current project rationale is valid and remains applicable. The current project scope has been revised to include some improvements to construction solutions. Additional financing is requested for 65% of the total overall project cost increase, the balance to be provided from government resources.\n", "name": "LAE PORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT-ADDITIONAL FINANCING"}
