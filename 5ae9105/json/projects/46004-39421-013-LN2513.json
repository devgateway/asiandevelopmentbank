It will have four main components: (i) a regulatory framework and fully operational quality and safety system for agro-products; (ii)\ninfrastructure and facilities for safe, quality agro-products; (iii) improved safety and reduced health hazards from livestock waste through support for development of biogas plants by small livestock farmers; and (iv) project management support for effective and timely implementation of project interventions. The Project will cover 16 provinces in Viet Nam that have significant fruit, vegetable, and tea production.", "name": "QUALITY & SAFETY ENHANCEMENT OF AGRI PROD & BIOGAS DEVT PROJECT"}
