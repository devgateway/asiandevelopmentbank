Both canals suffer under both scour and sedimentation and water levels (Shahrawan canal) and capacity (Archi canal) are compromised if no works are undertaken. The Shahrawan intake, the approach channel and outflow channel have degraded significantly and are in danger of being washed away. Failure of water delivery would negatively impact around 46,000 ha of crops. The Shahrawan intake headworks will be rehabilitated and upgraded to fully discharge its design flow (60 m3/s) in a controlled manner into the Shahrawan canal. The Archi main canal will be rehabilitated and upgraded to its original design capacity of 36 m3/s (current flow rate is estimated at 30 m3/s). The flow capacity of the canal will continually degrade in the future in the absence of the project, further reducing the current area of crops of 23,041 ha (ie 85.3% crop intensity). The technology proposed is compatible with local conditions and comprises mostly unlined canals, with lined canals in areas of high flows. The project will strengthen water management institutions through creating irrigation and water users associations, and strengthening river basin and sub-basin authorities. To ensure sufficient operations and maintenance (O&M) the concept of an irrigation service fee will be introduced in Lower Kokcha Irrigation Scheme (LKIS), tied to equity and reliability of water supply and incremental benefits.", "name": "MFF:WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM"}
