Project interventions will (i) enhance the regional data, information, and knowledge base for the management of floods and droughts; (ii) upgrade or develop water management infrastructure; and (iii) prepare communities to manage disasters such as floods and droughts, and adapt to climate change. Improved drought management and irrigation water structures in Cambodia will benefit farmers on about 16,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural lands, and at least 10,000 people will benefit from improved flood management.", "name": "GMS FLOOD AND DROUGHT RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION PROJECT"}
