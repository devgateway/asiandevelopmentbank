The focus will be on improvement of delivery of urban services to the poor and vulnerable in urban and peri-urban areas. The outcome of the project will be the establishment or improvement of high-priority infrastructure projects, such as roads and drains. The project will include (i) verification of detailed locations for the proposed infrastructure subprojects, (ii) design and installation of the infrastructure, (iii) capacity building and monitoring, and (iv) training of operators. The key overall outcomes will be (i) improved living conditions in urban and peri-urban areas and (ii) improved and better-coordinated urban planning and management.\n\nSpecific outputs include (i) improved roads and drains in the urban area; (ii) a major new drain to serve a low-lying inundated part of the urban area; (iii) capacity building in preventative maintenance.\n\nThe project will include construction of key infrastructure subprojects, and will ensure that they are sustainable through the establishment of maintenance funds and cost-recovery mechanisms, as well as training of operators and maintenance personnel. The project is expected to result in the establishment of a new urban planning and management unit.\n\nWith a focus on low-income areas, the proposed project will have substantial poverty reduction effects through improved living conditions, creation of bankable assets for the poor, and on-the-job training through employment opportunities related to project construction. \n", "name": "INTEGRATED URBAN DEVELOPMENT SECTOR PROJECT"}
