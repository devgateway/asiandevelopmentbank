The DPSP series\u2014cofinancing the Development Policy Loan (DPL) series supported by the World Bank and the Government of Japan\u2014is embedded in the Government\u2019s Medium-Term National Development Plan (RPJM) for 2004\u20132009. It supports the RPJM\u2019s broad goals of stimulating higher and sustainable economic growth (up to 7% average annual growth by 2009 from levels of around 4% prior to 2004) and halving poverty (to 8.2% by 2009 from 16.6% in 2004). To achieve these goals, DPSP-3 supports wide-ranging reforms in three core areas to (i) improve the investment climate, (ii) strengthen public financial management and anticorruption, and (iii) improve public service delivery. DPSP-3 is proposed as a single-tranche operation based on completed actions demonstrating satisfactory progress. While building on reforms undertaken during past DPSPs, DPSP-3 sets the groundwork for an expanded policy dialogue for future operations.", "name": "THIRD DEVELOPMENT POLICY SUPPORT PROGRAM"}
