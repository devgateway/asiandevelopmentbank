SIPRP V is intended to help the Government of Viet Nam carry out policy reforms that are needed to successfully implement its Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP), 2006-2010. To this end, SIPRP V is to provide parallel financing with the World Bank's poverty reduction support credits (PRSCs) 7-9 within the framework of the PRSC process. The PRSC provides direct budget support to the government subject to satisfactory progress being made on a set of policy actions. Subprogram 1 provided parallel financing with PRSC 7 and subprogram 2 with PRSC 8. The government's development policy letter is in Appendix 3.\n\nSubprogram 3 will provide parallel financing with PRSC 9, covering a subset of actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 9. Like the policy actions covered by subprograms 1 and 2, the actions under subprogram 3 fall into the four broad reform areas: business development, social inclusion, natural resource management, and governance. They complement actions supported by ADB's other program loans to Viet Nam or are otherwise important to ADB's operations in the country.", "name": "SUPPORT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POVERTY REDUCTION PROG-V"}
