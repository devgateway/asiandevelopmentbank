It will construct a double-circuit 220 kilovolt (kV) transmission line from Mingechevir hydropower plant to Absheron substation, to replace the existing two single-circuit 220 kV transmission lines (Mingechevir 1 and 2), which have been used for about 60 years. The Project will increase the capacity of the power transmission network in the west-to-east direction. This is crucial for ensuring the required stability of power supply to consumers in the key Azeri industrial and economic hub closest to the capital city of Baku.\n\nThe project components comprise (i) construction of a double-circuit 220 kV transmission line of 280 kilometers (km); (ii) construction of Agdash substation with installation of two 125 megavolt-ampere (MVA) transformers and associated 110 kV transmission lines near Agdash substations; (iii) expansion of Absheron substation; (iv) project management support; and (v) institutional strengthening.", "name": "POWER TRANSMISSION ENHANCEMENT PROJECT"}
