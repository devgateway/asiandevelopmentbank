Strategic Cross-Sector Reforms, resulting in:\n(a) Improved policy, legal and institutional framework for greater PSP that is anchored on good governance principles; (b) Well structured risk management framework that promotes PSP; and (c) Accelerated mobilization of domestic long-term financial resources for infrastructure development; and the establishment of innovative funding mechanisms to finance PPP transactions; and (d) Streamlined regional autonomy framework, clearly delineating functional responsibilities between national and local governments in infrastructure provision.\n\nII. Sector-Specific Policy, Legal, and Institutional Reforms, leading to:\n\n(a) Improved financial soundness and sustainability of infrastructure services through full cost recovery; (b) Greater competition that benefits the consumers through improved service delivery and lower tariffs; (c) Independent regulatory structures that are distinct from the contracting and operating functions; (d) A level playing field between the different actors, and the prevention of abuse of natural monopoly rights; and\n(e) Fulfillment of the PSOs of infrastructure service providers, in line with the Government's poverty reduction objectives. \n", "name": "INFRASTRUCTURE REFORM SECTOR DEV PROGRAM CLUSTER"}
