The energy savings will result from retrofitting existing equipment with more efficient equipment, which in aggregate will reduce the need to construct and operate a conventional coal-fired power plant. \n\nThe Project will consider only retrofits of proven energy efficiency technologies in the following areas: (i) motors and motor-drive systems; (ii) transformers and reactive power compensators; (iii) lighting; (iv) heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; (v) air compressors and pumping systems; (vi) recovery of waste energy from industry; (vii) coal-fired industrial boilers and industrial cogeneration; and (viii) other related energy efficiency improvement projects.\n\nThe Project will have multiple benefits: (i) energy security improves as lesser new power supply capacity will be needed to meet future demand, and less coal will be used for power generation; and (ii) the local and subregional environment improves, and the contribution to global climate change is lower because of avoided coal use.\n\n", "name": "MFF-GUANGDONG ENERGY EFFICIENY & ENVT IMPRVMNT INVSTMNT PROG-P2"}
