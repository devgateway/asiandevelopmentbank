No power transmission grid connects Sihanoukville to the national grid. The city gets its power from a small, isolated power system based on diesel generators. This mode of power generation is expensive, inefficient, as it does not achieve economies of scale, and cannot meet the demand. The Project will complement previous investments in the transmission and distribution facilities. It will (i) extend the 230 kilovolt (kV) transmission line from Kampot to Sihanoukville, (ii) build associated substations and bulk supply distribution facilities, and (iii) carry out institutional development and capacity building for Electricit\u00c2\u00bf du Cambodge (EDC).", "name": "SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT"}
