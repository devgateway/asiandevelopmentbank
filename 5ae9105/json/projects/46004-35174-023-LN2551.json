The ESP adopted a program cluster approach to phase ADB assistance. Three subprograms were envisioned in accordance with the time frame and progress of the SSR from 2007 onward. The ESP subprogram I, approved on 1 December 2006, supports the Nepal EFA program (2004-2009) for basic and primary education (grades 1-5) with a program loan for $30 million from FY2007 to FY2009. A capacity development grant of $2 million complements the ESP subprogram I to develop government stakeholders' capacity in policy analysis, formulation, and coordination. It also supports the preparation of an SSR core document. The ESP subprogram II, approved on 24 January 2008, supports the preparation and transition to SSR from FY2008 to FY2011, in particular a model-building exercise of the basic education extension to grades 1-8 in a few districts, as well as broad capacity development for system readiness.\nThe ESP subprogram III is proposed to support the Government in the implementation of the SSR program from 2009 onward. Subprogram III will cover the period from FY2010 to FY2012, during which the Government will focus on the implementation of basic education restructuring, while model building activities will be initiated for secondary education and technical education and vocational training (TEVT).\n", "name": "EDUCATION SECTOR PROGRAM-SUBPROGRAM 3"}
