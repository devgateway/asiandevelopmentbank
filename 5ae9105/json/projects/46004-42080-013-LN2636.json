These constraints are insufficient human resource capacity and inadequate public infrastructure. The project will address these constraints by funding education facilities to train engineers in water-related fields that are needed to meet the heightened demands of a rapidly growing economy. The project will also address the requirements of dilapidated irrigation and drainage infrastructure with funding to upgrade and modernize the management of irrigation canal systems. It will help the government increase the number of qualified agriculturerelated\nwater management engineers, improve the governance and management of irrigation systems, increase agricultural production, and improve the productivity of project areas to\nincrease poor farmers' incomes and reduce poverty.", "name": "STRENGTHENING H2O MGT & IRRIGATION_SYSTEMS REHABILITATION PROJ"}
