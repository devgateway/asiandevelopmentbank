It will alleviate the shortage of potable water in the Kathmandu Valley by diverting water from the Melamchi River to the Kathmandu Valley. Melamchi tunnel is a key component of the MWSP, and its performance impacts the pace and progress of several downstream water supply and wastewater projects in the Kathmandu Valley. The proposed loan is needed to meet cost overruns due to higher amount of the new contract for the Melamchi tunnel, and is important to achieve the expected outcomes of the Melamchi Water Suppy Project (MWSP). The proposed additional financing will not change the scope of the structured project.", "name": "MELAMCHI WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - ADDITIONAL FINANCING (SF)"}
