With regard to the Tranche 1 Project under the MFF, the financing plan will involve only ADB at this stage. It will amount to $60 million, of which $45 million will be for supplementary financing for civil works and $2 million on initial project\nmanagement work relating to existing projects. About $13 million will be in the form of contingencies. The subsequent tranches will be for around $100 million each, except the fourth, which is estimated at $140 million.
