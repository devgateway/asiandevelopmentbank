The region is a desert and many people are poor and the economic growth necessary to reduce rural poverty has failed to develop because of inadequate transport services and high costs. The local governments and people living in the region see the development of the logistics facility as a key investment for addressing this problem. Logistics development is a part of the Government's program for the integrated development of free economic zone in this poor region, which shares borders with the PRC and is the main gateway for Mongolia's trade with the PRC and other parts of the world. The development of this facility is expected to play an important role in facilitating and integrating this poor and underdeveloped region, and stimulating international, regional and domestic trade. The proposed Project is in line with the National Development Plan and the Government's Regional Development Strategy. \n\nThe Project is a key intervention in the transport sector, with many technical, operational, safety, and economic benefits. It seeks to introduce well developed logistics terminal equipped with modern technology and managed by private sector through a management contract for enhanced efficiency, increased throughput, and improved reliability--all of which will lead to a more affordable, faster, cheap, safe transport services in Mongolia. ADB intervention in financing this facility is expected to play a catalytic role in facilitating the flow of further foreign and private capital to finance the development of logistics in Mongolia.\n", "name": "REGIONAL LOGISTICS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT"}
