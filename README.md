## Phil's notes

### Routing

I removed the default router from yeogurt called [director](https://github.com/flatiron/director), and replaced it with [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/).

React-router does not need all the boilerplate files that director needed, it knows about react components so it just works.
