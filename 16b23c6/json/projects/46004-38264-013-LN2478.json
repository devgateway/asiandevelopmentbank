The key expected benefits are as follows: (i) Strengthened management and coordination of fiscal decentralization by the central Government, and improved leadership, supervision, and coordination of the capacity\ndevelopment of regional governments. (ii) Clearer assignment of expenditures between levels of government and improved criteria for establishing new regional governments, leading to more efficient allocation of expenditures and better vertical balance in financing between levels of government. (iii) Improved technical and policy environment for\nintergovernmental fiscal transfers, revenue sharing, and local own-source revenues, leading to more transparent and equitable outcomes across regions (better horizontal\nbalance), and less dependence on central government transfers. (iv) Strengthened management of regional reserves and debts, contributing to better access to long-term\ninvestment financing for infrastructure. (v) Enhanced organizational, systems, and human resource capacity of regional governments, particularly to manage and report finances and to measure performance, thus improving public service delivery and accountability. (vi) Strengthened governance through coordinated performance monitoring and evaluation to improve accountability.", "bounds": [[95.01270592500012, -10.922621351999808, 140.97762699400008, 5.910101630000099]], "name": "2ND LOCAL GOVT FINANCE & GOVERNANCE REFORM PROGRAM CLUSTER-SUBP1", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}}}
