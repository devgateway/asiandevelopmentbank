The proposed project will: (i) improve overall efficiency of electricity distribution in the Java Bali grid, and (ii) promote demand side management practices (new technology and behaviors) to reduce waste by educating customers and PLN staff on these practices and providing energy-efficient equipment. \n", "bounds": [[95.01270592500012, -10.922621351999808, 140.97762699400008, 5.910101630000099]], "name": "JAVA BALI ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PROJEC", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[352.21722, 110.36083], [353.88639, 106.89083], [353.82194, 106.63], [352.75083, 112.75083], [352.29377, 114.00976], [352.5522, 112.7183], [352.1315, 111.462], [351.1677, 115.1247], [351.6103, 115.2526], [352.3547, 112.9075], [352.8432, 113.4746], [352.0203, 112.6304], [352.3702, 111.5239], [353.7317, 106.8699], [352.18333, 112.01667], [353.69667, 107.30556], [351.83396, 113.70317], [352.2606, 112.5099], [352.5, 110.0], [353.25, 107.5], [353.78611, 106.86722], [353.7818, 106.8584], [352.84611, 112.65611], [353.6, 106.81861], [352.8498, 111.8817], [353.40556, 106.78917], [353.7651, 106.9896], [353.96833, 106.20278], [353.09611, 107.61861], [351.5, 115.0], [353.5, 106.25], [352.79056, 110.48944], [352.50056, 111.035], [351.7785, 114.3646]]}}}
