Participating general corporations will be restructured under a comprehensive package of corporate and financial restructuring and enhanced operational efficiency and corporate governance. Debt restructuring will strengthen general corporation balance sheets through improved cash flows and debt-servicing capacity, generating additional resources for productive activities. None of the restructured debt will be nonperforming loans. Corporate restructuring will enable participating general corporations to exploit economies of both scale and scope by merging several small joint stock subsidiaries in each general corporation into larger entities organized along lines of business, combined with the divestiture of disparate non-core business units. Additionally, management restructuring will enhance operational efficiency by strengthening corporate management processes and improving governance. OCR will be used to support financial and corporate restructuring, while operational restructuring and improved corporate governance will be supported by the complementary loan component funded from ADF resources.", "bounds": [[102.11865523300011, 8.565578518000152, 109.47242272200018, 23.366275127000122]], "name": "MFF-SOE REFORM & CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FACIL PROGRAM-PROJECT 1", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[16.16667, 107.83333]]}}}
