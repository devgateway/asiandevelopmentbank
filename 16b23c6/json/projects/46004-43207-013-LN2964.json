{"id": "46004-43207-013-LN2964", "info": "The proposed project will replace 100,000 gasoline tricycles (motorcycles with a passenger sidecar) with three wheel plug-in electric vehicles running on an electric motor and rechargeable battery (e-trikes). The project will initiate a transformation of the tricycle subsector by (i) improving the livelihoods of tricycle drivers through higher incomes and a better work environment; (ii) generating global environmental benefits and reducing the carbon footprint of the tricycle industry through the introduction of low-carbon, e-trike technology; and (iii) leveraging private sector participation in the e-trike market. The Government of the Philippines plans to introduce clean and efficient energy technology, provide affordable financing modalities, generate demand, develop technical capacity, create support infrastructure, and allocate new technology risk to the suppliers. The government will target selected cities in Metro Manila and other urban centers where tricycles are widely used. \n", "bounds": [[116.95492597700016, 4.655707098000107, 126.61768639400017, 21.122381903000033]], "name": "MARKET TRANSFORMATION THRU-INTRO/-ENRGY EFFICIENT ELEC VEHICLES", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[15.48017, 120.59794], [14.2814, 121.4161], [14.6488, 121.0509], [10.1038, 125.4815], [14.48156, 121.01749], [15.58333, 121.0], [14.6042, 120.9822], [14.5832, 121.0409], [11.90027, 121.90911], [14.55027, 121.03269], [14.1798, 121.2234], [13.9411, 121.1631], [7.06955, 125.59845], [16.0475, 120.34083], [14.65, 120.96667], [15.48586, 120.96648], [14.67611, 120.53611], [11.98013, 121.91932]]}}}
