The Southern Highway is the country's first controlled-access expressway, and the Colombo-Galle section of 95 kilometers (km), cofinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, will become operational in 2011. By enhancing connectivity and reducing access time for the communities served, the proposed improvement is critical to ensuring that the development impact of the Southern Highway is optimized and its benefits reaped in a timely way. Collectively, the communities served will benefit from improved, lower-cost, and faster transport services and thereby obtain improved access to economic opportunities and social services. It  facilitates economic growth and contribute to reducing disparities in Sri Lanka, consistent with the government's goal of equitable economic growth.", "bounds": [[79.65577233200005, 5.92373281500015, 81.89031009200008, 9.829575914000145]], "name": "NATIONAL HIGHWAYS SECTOR PROJECT-ADDT'L FINANCING", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[7.41667, 80.65], [6.5646, 79.988], [5.94851, 80.53528], [6.881, 79.8803], [6.7914, 79.9378], [6.5573, 79.9715], [6.1407, 80.1012], [6.8506, 80.033], [6.25, 80.25], [6.8664, 80.0166], [7.0, 81.25], [6.4394, 79.9895], [6.1718, 80.1861], [6.87734, 79.86944]]}}}
