{"id": "46004-41116-023-LN2331", "info": "The proposed investment program will foster economic revival in J&K, where trade, services, and tourism are the principal drivers of the economy. Low investment in asset creation and in operation and maintenance (O&M) and lack of structured institutional systems constrain growth in J&K. The state government intends to promote economic growth through better service, public health, and environmental conditions by investing in urban infrastructure and improving the management capabilities of its line agencies and the participating cities and towns. The core strategy is to provide investment funds in a prioritised manner, building on the infrastructure rehabilitation being carried out under the ongoing loan (2151-IND: Multisector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in J&K), with planned expansion in tandem with urban governance improvements and reforms. The state needs to balance progress on reforms, priority infrastructure investments, and private sector investment particularly in trade and tourism. A sector loan with an MFF offers the borrower the flexibility of basing investment decisions on priorities and constraints defined in the sector policy and master plans. The subsector master plans being developed as part of the ongoing loan will form the basis for investments made under the Facility.", "bounds": [[68.1434025400001, 6.74555084800015, 97.36225305200006, 35.49540557900009]], "name": "MFF-JAMMU & KASHMIR URBAN SECTOR DEVT INVESTMENT PRGRM-PRJ 1", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[32.92431, 75.13573], [34.08842, 74.80298], [32.37068, 75.52457], [34.55764, 76.12622], [33.91667, 76.66667], [32.73569, 74.86911], [34.209, 74.34285], [33.72993, 75.15167]]}}}
