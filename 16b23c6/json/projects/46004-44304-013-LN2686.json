Outputs 1, 2 and 3 will strengthen the capacity of the microfinance industry to provide financial services to a broader cross-section of the community and strengthen the capacity of its clients and potential clients to utilize these financial services. Output 4 will provide appropriate regulation for, and supervision of, microfinance institutions (MFI) and savings and loan societies (SLS) through the Bank of PNG (BPNG). Output 5 will seek to increase lending to micro and small enterprises (MSE) to increase rural income generation. Output 6 will provide efficient and effective project management services to the Project. As a result participating financial institutions (PFIs) throughout PNG, which will be identified through a series of institutional assessments, will be better able to provide profitable, appropriate, reliable and safe financial services to financially literate clients and capable businesses.", "bounds": [[140.84921106000016, -11.636325778999847, 155.96753991, -1.346368096999882]], "name": "MICROFINANCE EXPANSION PROJECT", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[354.0, 147.0]]}}}
