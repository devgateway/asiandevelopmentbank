The Program will help meet critical public expenditures such as social allowances, employment programs, and food and utilities expenses of social institutions. \n\nThe Program is fully in line with the Government's economic stabilization and expenditure management programs. Under the latter, the Government has prioritized specific social and safety net expenditures for the revised 2009 budget. Program proceeds will help meet some of the prioritized public expenditures.\n\nThe Program has four special features:\nFirst, it is anchored fully on the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), which sets out the key macroeconomic parameters and identifies priority reform measures. \n Second, it uses the Program-Based Approach recognized under Asian Development Bank's (ADB's) Program Lending Policy. TCSP is structured on the Government's crisis mitigation program. The Government has adopted a crisis budget, which cuts non-essential expenditures and prioritizes social sector spending. ADB's financing will be part of the overall financing plan of the crisis mitigation program.\n Third, TCSP does not have a policy matrix or separate reform measures, in order to swiftly meet the counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus needs of Tajikistan.\n Fourth, ADB-through technical assistance and close coordination with other development partners-will focus on ensuring good financial management of the crisis-mitigation program.  \n\n", "bounds": [[67.34269006300022, 36.67864084900019, 75.16412479700008, 41.039976705000086]], "name": "CRISIS RECOVERY SUPPORT PROGRAM", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}}}
