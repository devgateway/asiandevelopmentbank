Improvement of this road, much of which is currently gravel and earth, will facilitate increased exports to Thailand of agricultural goods produced in the project area and increased tourism from Thailand to Louangphrabang. The Project comprises (i) improvement of 367 km of the project road from Ziang Ngeun (the junction with National Route 13 near Louangphrabang) to Nakha, construction of a bridge over the Mekong River on the project (if financing is available), and improvement of approximately 100 km of rural access roads in the project area; (ii) procurement of equipment for use in operating the border post at Kenthao, now under construction, and for enforcement of axle-load controls on the project road; (iii) consulting services for construction supervision and monitoring and evaluation as well as detailed design for the rural access roads; (iv) maintenance of the national road network by financing consulting services to continue the ongoing road safety assistance program; and (vi) a program to reduce the risks of HIV and sexually transmitted infections and human trafficking that may develop during the rehabilitation and operation of the project road.", "bounds": [[100.0970732020001, 13.91545664500012, 107.66436324000011, 22.49604400700011]], "name": "NORTHERN GREATER MEKONG SUBREGION TRANSPORT NEWTWO", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[19.3229, 101.59536], [18.39471, 101.50389], [19.40005, 101.94556], [19.75532, 102.17891], [19.09905, 101.52542], [18.21609, 101.40888], [17.73449, 101.39925], [17.59564, 101.18492], [20.25, 102.66667], [17.50697, 101.0824], [18.03359, 101.31866], [18.87675, 101.47001], [17.59298, 101.1858]]}}}
