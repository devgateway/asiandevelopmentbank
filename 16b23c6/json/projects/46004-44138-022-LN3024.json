There is essentially unlimited demand from these countries for Lao agricultural and rural produce. Better AI will enable more diversity and value addition to agricultural produce from the target provinces. This will expand sustainable livelihoods opportunities. \n\nThe Project aims to regenerate and upgrade existing but underdeveloped or outdated AI in the two target provinces over a period of eight years. The proposed project is consistent with the government s sector development objectives as presented in its Seventh National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2011-2015), Strategy for Agricultural Development to 2020, Agricultural Master Plan 2011-2015, which promotes the expansion of market-oriented agricultural production in an environmentally sensitive manner. It will be a key component in the Government s new Southern Rural Development Program (SRDP), which is currently under formulation with the support of IFAD.\n\nThe design draws upon the experience of recent rural development initiatives that ADB has financed  as well as rural development initiatives financed by the World Bank - Poverty Reduction Fund, and by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) - Participatory Irrigated Agriculture Development Project (PIADP). \n\n", "bounds": [[100.0970732020001, 13.91545664500012, 107.66436324000011, 22.49604400700011]], "name": "GMS EAST-WEST ECON CORRIDOR AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORPROJ", "locations": {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[16.5, 105.75], [15.75, 106.25]]}}}
